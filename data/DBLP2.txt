the combination of flit buffer flow control methods and latency insensitive protocols is an effective solution for networks on chip noc since they both rely on backpressure the two techniques are easy to combine while offering complementary advantages low complexity of router design and the ability to cope with long communication channels via automatic wire pipelining we study various alternative implementations of this idea by considering the combination of three different types of flit buffer flow control methods and two different classes of channel repeaters based respectively on flip flops and relay stations we characterize the area and performance of the two most promising alternative implementations for nocs by completing the rtl design and logic synthesis of the repeaters and routers for different channel parallelisms finally we derive high level abstractions of our circuit designs and we use them to perform system level simulations under various scenarios for two distinct noc topologies and various applications based on our comparative analysis and experimental results we propose noc design approach that combines the reduction of the router queues to minimum size with the distribution of flit buffering onto the channels this approach provides precious flexibility during the physical design phase for many nocs particularly in those systems on chip that must be designed to meet tight constraint on the target clock frequency
we present an easy to use model that addresses the practical issues in designing bus based shared memory multiprocessor systems the model relates the shared bus width bus cycle time cache memory the features of program execution and the number of processors on shared bus to metric called request utilization the request utilization is treated as the scaling factor for the effective average waiting processors in computing the queuing delay cycles simulation study shows that the model performs very well in estimating the shared bus response time using the model system designer can quickly decide the number of the processors that shared bus is able to support effectively the size of the cache memory system should use and the bus cycle time that the main memory system should provide with the model we show that the design favors caching the requests for contention based medium instead of speeding up the transfers although the same performance can be respectively achieved by the two techniques in contention free situation
software product lines spls are used to create tailor made software products by managing and composing reusable assets generating software product from the assets of an spl is possible statically before runtime or dynamically at load time or runtime both approaches have benefits and drawbacks with respect to composition flexibility performance and resource consumption which type of composition is preferable should be decided by taking the application scenario into account current tools and languages however force programmer to decide between static and dynamic composition during development in this paper we present an approach that employs code generation to support static and dynamic composition of features of single code base we offer an implementation on top of featurec an extension of the programming language that supports software composition based on features to simplify dynamic composition and to avoid creation of invalid products we furthermore provide means to validate the correctness of composition at runtime automatically instantiate spls in case of stand alone applications and automatically apply interaction code of crosscutting concerns
experience has proved that interactive applications delivered through digital tv must provide personalized information to the viewers in order to be perceived as valuable service due to the limited computational power of dtv receivers either domestic set top boxes or mobile devices most of the existing systems have opted to place the personalization engines in dedicated servers assuming that return channel is always available for bidirectional communication however in domain where most of the information is transmitted through broadcast there are still many cases of intermittent sporadic or null access to return channel in such situations it is impossible for the servers to learn who is watching tv at the moment and so the personalization features become unavailable to solve this problem without sacrificing much personalization quality this paper introduces solutions to run downsized semantic reasoning process in the dtv receivers supported by pre selection of material driven by audience stereotypes in the head end evaluation results are presented to prove the feasibility of this approach and also to assess the quality it achieves in comparison with previous ones
model based testing techniques play vital role in producing quality software however compared to the testing of functional requirements these techniques are not prevalent that much in testing software security this paper presents model based approach to automatic testing of attack scenarios an attack testing framework is proposed to model attack scenarios and test the system with respect to the modeled attack scenarios the techniques adopted in the framework are applicable in general to the systems where the potential attack scenarios can be modeled in formalism based on extended abstract state machines the attack events ie attack test vectors chosen from the attacks happening in real world are converted to the test driver specific events ready to be tested against the attack signatures the proposed framework is implemented and evaluated using the most common attack scenarios the framework is useful to test software with respect to potential attacks which can significantly reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities
in this paper we address the problem of cache replacement for transcoding proxy caching transcoding proxy is proxy that has the functionality of transcoding multimedia object into an appropriate format or resolution for each client we first propose an effective cache replacement algorithm for transcoding proxy in general when new object is to be cached cache replacement algorithms evict some of the cached objects with the least profit to accommodate the new object our algorithm takes into account of the inter relationships among different versions of the same multimedia object and selects the versions to replace according to their aggregate profit which usually differs from simple summation of their individual profits as assumed in the existing algorithms it also considers cache consistency which is not considered in the existing algorithms we then present complexity analysis to show the efficiency of our algorithm finally we give extensive simulation results to compare the performance of our algorithm with some existing algorithms the results show that our algorithm outperforms others in terms of various performance metrics
distributed proof construction protocols have been shown to be valuable for reasoning about authorization decisions in open distributed environments such as pervasive computing spaces unfortunately existing distributed proof protocols offer only limited support for protecting the confidentiality of sensitive facts which limits their utility in many practical scenarios in this paper we propose distributed proof construction protocol in which the release of fact's truth value can be made contingent upon facts managed by other principals in the system we formally prove that our protocol can safely prove conjunctions of facts without leaking the truth values of individual facts even in the face of colluding adversaries and fact release policies with cyclical dependencies this facilitates the definition of context sensitive release policies that enable the conditional use of sensitive facts in distributed proofs
in this paper we introduce novel approach to image completion which we call structure propagation in our system the user manually specifies important missing structure information by extending few curves or line segments from the known to the unknown regions our approach synthesizes image patches along these user specified curves in the unknown region using patches selected around the curves in the known region structure propagation is formulated as global optimization problem by enforcing structure and consistency constraints if only single curve is specified structure propagation is solved using dynamic programming when multiple intersecting curves are specified we adopt the belief propagation algorithm to find the optimal patches after completing structure propagation we fill in the remaining unknown regions using patch based texture synthesis we show that our approach works well on number of examples that are challenging to state of the art techniques

super resolution reconstruction of face image is the problem of reconstructing high resolution face image from one or more low resolution face images assuming that high and low resolution images share similar intrinsic geometries various recent super resolution methods reconstruct high resolution images based on weights determined from nearest neighbors in the local embedding of low resolution images these methods suffer disadvantages from the finite number of samples and the nature of manifold learning techniques and hence yield unrealistic reconstructed images to address the problem we apply canonical correlation analysis cca which maximizes the correlation between the local neighbor relationships of high and low resolution images we use it separately for reconstruction of global face appearance and facial details experiments using collection of frontal human faces show that the proposed algorithm improves reconstruction quality over existing state of the art super resolution algorithms both visually and using quantitative peak signal to noise ratio assessment

in many advanced database applications eg multimedia databases data objects are transformed into high dimensional points and manipulated in high dimensional space one of the most important but costly operations is the similarity join that combines similar points from multiple datasets in this paper we examine the problem of processing nearest neighbor similarity join knn join knn join between two datasets and returns for each point in its most similar points in we propose new index based knn join approach using the idistance as the underlying index structure we first present its basic algorithm and then propose two different enhancements in the first enhancement we optimize the original knn join algorithm by using approximation bounding cubes in the second enhancement we exploit the reduced dimensions of data space we conducted an extensive experimental study using both synthetic and real datasets and the results verify the performance advantage of our schemes over existing knn join algorithms
caches exploits locality of references to reduce memory access latencies and thereby improve processor performance when an operating system switches application task or performs other kernel services the assumption of locality may be violated because the instructions and data may no longer be in the cache when the preempted operation is resumed thus these operations have an additional cache interference cost that must be taken into account when calculating or estimating the performance and responsiveness of the systemin this paper we present simulation framework suitable for examining the cache interference cost in preemptive real time systems using this framework we measure the interference cost for operating system services and set of embedded benchmarksthe simulations show that there are significant performance gap between the best and worst case execution times even for simple hardware architectures also the worst case performance of some software modules was found to be more or less independent of the cache configuration these results can be used to get better understanding of the execution behavior of preemptive real time systems and can serve as guidelines for choosing suitable cache configurations
in this paper we consider the restless bandit problem which is one of the most well studied generalizations of the celebrated stochastic multi armed bandit problem in decision theory in its ultimate generality the restless bandit problem is known to be pspace hard to approximate to any non trivial factor and little progress has been made on this problem despite its significance in modeling activity allocation under uncertainty we make progress on this problem by showing that for an interesting and general subclass that we term monotone bandits surprisingly simple and intuitive greedy policy yields factor approximation such greedy policies are termed index policies and are popular due to their simplicity and their optimality for the stochastic multi armed bandit problem the monotone bandit problem strictly generalizes the stochastic multi armed bandit problem and naturally models multi project scheduling where the state of project becomes increasingly uncertain when the project is not scheduled we develop several novel techniques in the design and analysis of the index policy our algorithm proceeds by introducing novel balance constraint to the dual of well known lp relaxation to the restless bandit problem this is followed by structural characterization of the optimal solution by using both the exact primal as well as dual complementary slackness conditions this yields an interpretation of the dual variables as potential functions from which we derive the index policy and the associated analysis
we introduce straightforward robust and efficient algorithm for rendering high quality soft shadows in dynamic scenes each frame points in the scene visible from the eye are inserted into spatial acceleration structure shadow umbrae are computed by sampling the scene from the light at the image plane coordinates given by the stored points penumbrae are computed at the same set of points per silhouette edge in two steps first the set of points affected by given edge is estimated from the expected light view screen space bounds of the corresponding penumbra second the actual overlap between these points and the penumbra is computed analytically directly from the occluding geometry the umbral and penumbral sources of occlusion are then combined to determine the degree of shadow at the eye view pixel corresponding to each sample point an implementation of this algorithm for the larrabee architecture yields from to frames per second in simulation for scenes from modern game and produces significantly higher image quality than other recent methods in the real time domain

in this paper we propose the novel concept of probabilistic design for multimedia embedded systems which is motivated by the challenge of how to design but not overdesign such systems while systematically incorporating performance requirements of multimedia application uncertainties in execution time and tolerance for reasonable execution failures unlike most present techniques that are based on either worst or average case execution times of application tasks where the former guarantees the completion of each execution but often leads to overdesigned systems and the latter fails to provide any completion guarantees the proposed probabilistic design method takes advantage of unique features mentioned above of multimedia systems to relax the rigid hardware requirements for software implementation and avoid overdesigning the system in essence this relaxation expands the design space and we further develop an off line on line minimum effort algorithm for quick exploration of the enlarged design space at early design stages this is the first step toward our goal of bridging the gap between real time analysis and embedded software implementation for rapid and economic multimedia system design it is our belief that the proposed method has great potential in reducing system resource while meeting performance requirements the experimental results confirm this as we achieve significant saving in system's energy consumption to provide statistical completion ratio guarantee ie the expected number of completions over large number of iterations is greater than given value

to keep up with the explosive internet packet processing demands modern network processors nps employ highly parallel multi threaded and multi core architecture in such parallel paradigm accesses to the shared variables in the external memory and the associated memory latency are contained in the critical sections so that they can be executed atomically and sequentially by different threads in the network processor in this paper we present novel program transformation that is used in the intel auto partitioning compiler for ixp to exploit the inherent finer grained parallelism of those critical sections using the software controlled caching mechanism available in the nps consequently those critical sections can be executed in pipelined fashion by different threads thereby effectively hiding the memory latency and improving the performance of network applications experimental results show that the proposed transformation provides impressive speedup up to and scalability up to threads of the performance for the real world network application lgbps efhernet core metro router
we show that if connected graph with nodes has conductance then rumour spreading also known as randomized broadcast successfully broadcasts message within log many rounds with high probability regardless of the source by using the push pull strategy the notation hides polylog factor this result is almost tight since there exists graph of nodes and conductance with diameter log if in addition the network satisfies some kind of uniformity condition on the degrees our analysis implies that both both push and pull by themselves successfully broadcast the message to every node in the same number of rounds
although database design tools have been developed that attempt to automate or semiautomate the design process these tools do not have the capability to capture common sense knowledge about business applications and store it in context specific manner as result they rely on the user to provide great deal of trivial details and do not function as well as human designer who usually has some general knowledge of how an application might work based on his or her common sense knowledge of the real world common sense knowledge could be used by database design system to validate and improve the quality of an existing design or even generate new designs this requires that context specific information about different database design applications be stored and generalized into information about specific application domains eg pharmacy daycare hospital university manufacturing such information should be stored at the appropriate level of generality in hierarchically structured knowledge base so that it can be inherited by the subdomains below for this to occur two types of learning must take place first knowledge about particular application domain that is acquired from specific applications within that domain are generalized into domain node eg entities relationships and attributes from various hospital applications are generalized to hospital node this is referred to as within domain learning second the information common to two or more related application domain nodes is generalized to higher level node for example knowledge from the car rental and video rental domains may be generalized to rental node this is called across domain learning this paper presents methodology for learning across different application domains based on distance measure the parameters used in this methodology were refined by testing on set of representative cases empirical testing provided further validation
in this paper we address the problem of clustering graphs in object oriented databases unlike previous studies which focused only on workload consisting of single operation this study tackles the problem when the workload is set of operations method and queries that occur with certain probability thus the goal is to minimize the expected cost of an operation in the workload while maintaining similarly low cost for each individual operation classto this end we present new clustering policy based on the nearest neighbor graph partitioning algorithm we then demonstrate that this policy provides considerable gains when compared to suite of well known clustering policies proposed in the literature our results are based on two widely referenced object oriented database benchmarks namely the tektronix hypermodel and oo
integrating several legacy software systems together is commonly performed with multiple applications of the adapter design pattern in oo languages such as java the integration is based on specifying bi directional translations between pairs of apis from different systems yet manual development of wrappers to implement these translations is tedious expensive and error prone in this paper we explore how models aspects and generative techniques can be used in conjunction to alleviate the implementation of multiple wrappers briefly the steps are the automatic reverse engineering of relevant concepts in apis to high level models the manual definition of mapping relationships between concepts in different models of apis using an ad hoc dsl the automatic generation of wrappers from these mapping specifications using aop this approach is weighted against manual development of wrappers using an industrial case study criteria are the relative code length and the increase of automation
higher order abstract syntax is simple technique for implementing languages with functional programming object variables and binders are implemented by variables and binders in the host language by using this technique one can avoid implementing common and tricky routines dealing with variables such as capture avoiding substitution however despite the advantages this technique provides it is not commonly used because it is difficult to write sound elimination forms such as folds or catamorphisms for higher order abstract syntax to fold over such data type one must either simultaneously define an inverse operation which may not exist or show that all functions embedded in the data type are parametric in this paper we show how first class polymorphism can be used to guarantee the parametricity of functions embedded in higher order abstract syntax with this restriction we implement library of iteration operators over data structures containing functionals from this implementation we derive fusion laws that functional programmers may use to reason about the iteration operator finally we show how this use of parametric polymorphism corresponds to the schürmann despeyroux and pfenning method of enforcing parametricity through modal types we do so by using this library to give sound and complete encoding of their calculus into system private char inline graphic mime subtype gif xlink schar private char this encoding can serve as starting point for reasoning about higher order structures in polymorphic languages
we introduce theoretical framework for discovering relationships between two database instances over distinct and unknown schemata this framework is grounded in the context of data exchange we formalize the problem of understanding the relationship between two instances as that of obtaining schema mapping so that minimum repair of this mapping provides perfect description of the target instance given the source instance we show that this definition yields intuitive results when applied on database instances derived from each other by basic operations we study the complexity of decision problems related to this optimality notion in the context of different logical languages and show that even in very restricted cases the problem is of high complexity
mining association rules is an important technique for discovering meaningful patterns in transaction databases many different measures of interestingness have been proposed for association rules however these measures fail to take the probabilistic properties of the mined data into account we start this paper with presenting simple probabilistic framework for transaction data which can be used to simulate transaction data when no associations are present we use such data and real world database from grocery outlet to explore the behavior of confidence and lift two popular interest measures used for rule mining the results show that confidence is systematically influenced by the frequency of the items in the left hand side of rules and that lift performs poorly to filter random noise in transaction data based on the probabilistic framework we develop two new interest measures hyper lift and hyper confidence which can be used to filter or order mined association rules the new measures show significantly better performance than lift for applications where spurious rules are problematic
in spite of impressive gains by pl fortran and cobol remain the languages in which most of the world's production programs are written and will remain so into the foreseeable future there is great deal of theoretical interest in algol and in extensible languages but so far at least they have had little practical impact problem oriented languages may very well become the most important language development area in the next five to ten years in the operating system area all major computer manufacturers set out to produce very ambitious multiprogramming systems and they all ran into similar problems number of university projects though not directly comparable to those of the manufacturers have contributed greatly to better understanding of operating system principles important trends include the increased interest in the development of system measurement and evaluation techniques and increased use of microprogramming for some programming system functions

we describe forward rasterization class of rendering algorithms designed for small polygonal primitives the primitive is efficiently rasterized by interpolation between its vertices the interpolation factors are chosen to guarantee that each pixel covered by the primitive receives at least one sample which avoids holes the location of the samples is recorded with subpixel accuracy using pair of offsets which are then used to reconstruct resample the output image offset reconstruction has good static and temporal antialiasing properties we present two forward rasterization algorithms one that renders quadrilaterals and is suitable for scenes modeled with depth images like in image based rendering by warping and one that renders triangles and is suitable for scenes modeled conventionally when compared to conventional rasterization forward rasterization is more efficient for small primitives and has better temporal antialiasing properties

as memory hierarchy becomes deeper and shared by more processors locality increasingly determines system performance as rigorous and precise locality model reuse distance has been used in program optimizations performance prediction memory disambiguation and locality phase prediction however the high cost of measurement has been severely impeding its uses in scenarios requiring high efficiency such as product compilers performance debugging run time optimizationswe recently discovered the statistical connection between time and reuse distance which led to an efficient way to approximate reuse distance using time however not exposed are some algorithmic and implementation techniques that are vital for the efficiency and scalability of the approximation model this paper presents these techniques it describes an algorithm that approximates reuse distance on arbitrary scales it explains portable scheme that employs memory controller to accelerate the measure of time distance it uncovers the algorithm and proof of trace generator that can facilitate various locality studies
retrieving images from large image collection has been an active area of research most of the existing works have focused on content representation in this paper we address the issue of identifying relevant images quickly this is important in order to meet the users performance requirements we propose framework for fast image retrieval based on object shapes extracted from objects within images the framework builds hierarchy of approximations on object shapes such that shape representation at higher level is coarser representation of shape at the lower level in other words multiple shapes at lower level can be mapped into single shape at higher level in this way the hierarchy serves to partition the database at various granularities given query shape by searching only the relevant paths in the hierarchy large portion of the database can thus be pruned away we propose the angle mapping am method to transform shape from one level to another higher level am essentially replaces some edges of shape by smaller number of edges based on the angles between the edges thus reducing the complexity of the original shape based on the framework we also propose two hierarchical structures to facilitate speedy retrieval the first called hierarchical partitioning on shape representation hpsr uses the shape representation as the indexing key the second called hierarchical partitioning on angle vector hpav captures the angle information from the shape representation we conducted an extensive study on both methods to see their quality and efficiency our experiments on sets of images each of which has objects around from to showed that the framework can provide speedy image retrieval without sacrificing on the quality both proposed schemes can improve the efficiency by as much as hundreds of times to sequential scanning the improvement grows as image database size objects per image or object dimension increase

existing template independent web data extraction approaches adopt highly ineffective decoupled strategies attempting to do data record detection and attribute labeling in two separate phases in this paper we propose an integrated web data extraction paradigm with hierarchical models the proposed model is called dynamic hierarchical markov random fields dhmrfs dhmrfs take structural uncertainty into consideration and define joint distribution of both model structure and class labels the joint distribution is an exponential family distribution as conditional model dhmrfs relax the independence assumption as made in directed models since exact inference is intractable variational method is developed to learn the model's parameters and to find the map model structure and label assignments we apply dhmrfs to real world web data extraction task experimental results show that integrated web data extraction models can achieve significant improvements on both record detection and attribute labeling compared to decoupled models in diverse web data extraction dhmrfs can potentially address the blocky artifact issue which is suffered by fixed structured hierarchical models
as the total amount of traffic data in networks has been growing at an alarming rate there is currently substantial body of research that attempts to mine traffic data with the purpose of obtaining useful information for instance there are some investigations into the detection of internet worms and intrusions by discovering abnormal traffic patterns however since network traffic data contain information about the internet usage patterns of users network users privacy may be compromised during the mining process in this paper we propose an efficient and practical method that preserves privacy during sequential pattern mining on network traffic data in order to discover frequent sequential patterns without violating privacy our method uses the repository server model which operates as single mining server and the retention replacement technique which changes the answer to query probabilistically in addition our method accelerates the overall mining process by maintaining the meta tables in each site so as to determine quickly whether candidate patterns have ever occurred in the site or not extensive experiments with real world network traffic data revealed the correctness and the efficiency of the proposed method

caching frequently accessed data items on the client side is an effective technique for improving performance in mobile environment classical cache invalidation strategies are not suitable for mobile environments due to frequent disconnections and mobility of the clients one attractive cache invalidation technique is based on invalidation reports irs however the ir based cache invalidation solution has two major drawbacks which have not been addressed in previous research first there is long query latency associated with this solution since client cannot answer the query until the next ir interval second when the server updates hot data item all clients have to query the server and get the data from the server separately which wastes large amount of bandwidth in this paper we propose an ir based cache invalidation algorithm which can significantly reduce the query latency and efficiently utilize the broadcast bandwidth detailed analytical analysis and simulation experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed methodology compared to previous ir based schemes our scheme can significantly improve the throughput and reduce the query latency the number of uplink request and the broadcast bandwidth requirements
physical database design is important for query performance in shared nothing parallel database system in which data is horizontally partitioned among multiple independent nodes we seek to automate the process of data partitioning given workload of sql statements we seek to determine automatically how to partition the base data across multiple nodes to achieve overall optimal or close to optimal performance for that workload previous attempts use heuristic rules to make those decisions these approaches fail to consider all of the interdependent aspects of query performance typically modeled by today's sophisticated query optimizerswe present comprehensive solution to the problem that has been tightly integrated with the optimizer of commercial shared nothing parallel database system our approach uses the query optimizer itself both to recommend candidate partitions for each table that will benefit each query in the workload and to evaluate various combinations of these candidates we compare rank based enumeration method with random based one our experimental results show that the former is more effective

we study new research problem where an implicit information retrieval query is inferred from eye movements measured when the user is reading and used to retrieve new documents in the training phase the user's interest is known and we learn mapping from how the user looks at term to the role of the term in the implicit query assuming the mapping is universal that is the same for all queries in given domain we can use it to construct queries even for new topics for which no learning data is available we constructed controlled experimental setting to show that when the system has no prior information as to what the user is searching the eye movements help significantly in the search this is the case in proactive search for instance where the system monitors the reading behaviour of the user in new topic in contrast during search or reading session where the set of inspected documents is biased towards being relevant stronger strategy is to search for content wise similar documents than to use the eye movements
in recent years network of workstations pcs so called now are becoming appealing vehicles for cost effective parallel computing due to the commodity nature of workstations and networking equipment lan environments are gradually becoming heterogeneous the diverse sources of heterogeneity in now systems pose challenge on the design of efficient communication algorithms for this class of systems in this paper we propose efficient algorithms for multiple multicast on heterogeneous now systems focusing on heterogeneity in processing speeds of workstations pcs multiple multicast is an important operation in many scientific and industrial applications multicast on heterogeneous systems has not been investigated until recently our work distinguishes itself from others in two aspects in contrast to the blocking communication model used in prior works we model communication in heterogeneous cluster more accurately by non blocking communication model and design multicast algorithms that can fully take advantage of non blocking communication while prior works focus on single multicast problem we propose efficient algorithms for general multiple multicast in which single multicast is special case on heterogeneous now systems to our knowledge our work is the earliest effort that addresses multiple multicast for heterogeneous now systems these algorithms are evaluated using network simulator for heterogeneous now systems our experimental results on system of up to nodes show that some of the algorithms outperform others in many cases the best algorithm achieves completion time that is within times of the lower bound
supporting quality of service qos in wireless networks has been very rich and interesting area of research many significant advances have been made in supporting qos in single wireless networks however the support for the qos across multiple heterogeneous wireless networks will be required in the future wireless networks in connections spanning multiple wireless networks the end to end qos will depend on several factors such as mobility and connection patterns of users and the qos policies in each of the wireless networks the end to end qos is also affected by multiple decisions that must be made by several different network entities for resource allocation the paper has two objectives one is to demonstrate the decision making process for resource allocation in multiple heterogeneous wireless networks and the second is to present novel concept of composite qos in such wireless environment more specifically we present an architecture for multiple heterogeneous wireless networks decision making process for resource request and allocation simulation model to study composite qos and several interesting results we also present potential implications of composite qos on users and network service providers we also show how the qos ideas presented in this paper can be used by wireless carriers for improved qos support and management the paper can form the basis for significant further research in dss for emerging wireless networks supporting qos for range of sophisticated and resource intensive mobile applications
this work addresses the problem of optimizing the deployment of sensors in order to ensure the quality of the readings of the value of interest in given critical geographic region as usual we assume that each sensor is capable of reading particular physical phenomenon eg concentration of toxic materials in the air and transmitting it to server or peer however the key assumptions considered in this work are each sensor is capable of moving where the motion may be remotely controlled and the spatial range for which the individual sensor's reading is guaranteed to be of desired quality is limited in scenarios like disaster management and homeland security in case some of the sensors dispersed in larger geographic area report value higher than certain threshold one may want to ensure quality of the readings for the affected region this in turn implies that one may want to ensure that there are enough sensors there and consequently guide subset of the rest of the sensors towards the affected region in this paper we explore variants of the problem of optimizing the guidance of the mobile sensors towards the affected geographic region and we present algorithms for their solutions
we describe in place reconfiguration ipr for lut based fpgas an algorithm that maximizes identical configuration bits for complementary inputs of lut thereby reducing the propagation of faults seen at pair of complementary inputs based on ipr we develop fault tolerant logic resynthesis algorithm which decreases the circuit fault rate while preserving functionality and topology of the lut based logic network since the topology is preserved the resynthesis algorithm can be applied post layout and without changes in physical design compared to the state of the art academic technology mapper berkeley abc ipr reduces the relative fault rate by and increases mttf by with the same area and performance and ipr combined with previous fault tolerant logic resynthesis algorithm rose reduces the relative fault rate by and increases mttf by with less area but same performance the above improvement assumes stochastic single fault and more improvement is expected for multi fault models

generic database replication algorithms do not scale linearly in throughput as all update deletion and insertion udi queries must be applied to every database replica the throughput is therefore limited to the point where the number of udi queries alone is sufficient to overload one server in such scenarios partial replication of database can help as udi queries are executed only by subset of all servers in this paper we propose globetp system that employs partial replication to improve database throughput globetp exploits the fact that web application's query workload is composed of small set of read and write templates using knowledge of these templates and their respective execution costs globetp provides database table placements that produce significant improvements in database throughput we demonstrate the efficiency of this technique using two different industry standard benchmarks in our experiments globetp increases the throughput by to compared to full replication while using identical hardware configuration furthermore adding single query cache improves the throughput by another to
many artificial intelligence tasks such as automated question answering reasoning or heterogeneous database integration involve verification of semantic category eg coffee is drink red is color while steak is not drink and big is not color we present novel algorithm to automatically validate semantic category contrary to the methods suggested earlier our approach does not rely on any manually codified knowledge but instead capitalizes on the diversity of topics and word usage on the world wide web we have tested our approach within our online fact seeking question answering environment when tested on the trec questions that expect the answer to belong to specific semantic category our approach has improved the accuracy by up to depending on the model and metrics used
in the rank join problem we are given set of relations and scoring function and the goal is to return the join results with the top scores it is often the case in practice that the inputs may be accessed in ranked order and the scoring function is monotonic these conditions allow for efficient algorithms that solve the rank join problem without reading all of the input in this article we present thorough analysis of such rank join algorithms strong point of our analysis is that it is based on more general problem statement than previous work making it more relevant to the execution model that is employed by database systems one of our results indicates that the well known hrjn algorithm has shortcomings because it does not stop reading its input as soon as possible we find that it is np hard to overcome this weakness in the general case but cases of limited query complexity are tractable we prove the latter with an algorithm that infers provably tight bounds on the potential benefit of reading more input in order to stop as soon as possible as result the algorithm achieves cost that is within constant factor of optimal

early applications of smart cards have focused in the area of personal security recently there has been an increasing demand for networked multi application cards in this new scenario enhanced application specific on card java applets and complex cryptographic services are executed through the smart card java virtual machine jvm in order to support such computation intensive applications contemporary smart cards are designed with built in microprocessors and memory as smart cards are highly area constrained environments with memory cpu and peripherals competing for very small die space the vm execution engine of choice is often small slow interpreter in addition support for multiple applications and cryptographic services demands high performance vm execution engine the above necessitates the optimization of the jvm for java cardsin this paper we present the concept of an annotation aware interpreter that optimizes the interpreted execution of java code using java bytecode superoperators sos sos are groups of bytecode operations that are executed as specialized vm instruction simultaneous translation of all the bytecode operations in an so reduces the bytecode dispatch cost and the number of stack accesses data transfer to from the java operand stack and stack pointer updates furthermore sos help improve native code quality without hindering class file portability annotation attributes in the class files mark the occurrences of valuable sos thereby dispensing the expensive task of searching and selecting sos at runtime besides our annotation based approach incurs minimal memory overhead as opposed to just in time jit compilerswe obtain an average speedup of using an interpreter customized with the top sos formed from operation folding patterns further we show that greater speedups could be achieved by statically adding to the interpreter application specific sos formed by top basic blocks the effectiveness of our approach is evidenced by performance improvements of upto obtained using sos formed from optimized basic blocks
engineering knowledge is specific kind of knowledge that is oriented to the production of particular classes of artifacts is typically related to disciplined design methods and takes place in tool intensive contexts as consequence representing engineering knowledge requires the elaboration of complex models that combine functional and structural representations of the resulting artifacts with process and methodological knowledge the different categories used in the engineering domain vary in their status and in the way they should be manipulated when building applications that support engineering processes these categories include artifacts activities methods and models this paper surveys existing models of engineering knowledge and discusses an upper ontology that abstracts the categories that crosscut different engineering domains such an upper model can be reused for particular engineering disciplines the process of creating such elaborations is reported on the particular case study of software engineering as concrete application example
recent works have shown the benefits of keyword proximity search in querying xml documents in addition to text documents for example given query keywords over shakespeare's plays in xml the user might be interested in knowing how the keywords cooccur in this paper we focus on xml trees and define xml keyword proximity queries to return the possibly heterogeneous set of minimum connecting trees mcts of the matches to the individual keywords in the query we consider efficiently executing keyword proximity queries on labeled trees xml in various settings when the xml database has been preprocessed and when no indices are available on the xml database we perform detailed experimental evaluation to study the benefits of our approach and show that our algorithms considerably outperform prior algorithms and other applicable approaches
many current research efforts address the problem of personalizing the web experience for each user with respect to user's identity and or context in this paper we propose new high level model for the specification of web applications that takes into account the manner in which users interact with the application for supplying appropriate contents or gathering profile data we therefore consider entire behaviors rather than single properties as the smallest information units allowing for automatic restructuring of application components for this purpose high level event condition action eca paradigm is proposed which enables capturing arbitrary and timed clicking behaviors also the architecture and components of first prototype implementation are discussed
one reason that researchers may wish to demonstrate that an external software quality attribute can be measured consistently is so that they can validate prediction system for the attribute however attempts at validating prediction systems for external subjective quality attributes have tended to rely on experts indicating that the values provided by the prediction systems informally agree with the experts intuition about the attribute these attempts are undertaken without pre defined scale on which it is known that the attribute can be measured consistently consequently valid unbiased estimate of the predictive capability of the prediction system cannot be given because the experts measurement process is not independent of the prediction system's values usually no justification is given for not checking to see if the experts can measure the attribute consistently it seems to be assumed that subjective measurement isn't proper measurement or subjective measurement cannot be quantified or no one knows the true values of the attributes anyway and they cannot be estimated however even though the classification of software systems or software artefacts quality attributes is subjective it is possible to quantify experts measurements in terms of conditional probabilities it is then possible using statistical approach to assess formally whether the experts measurements can be considered consistent if the measurements are consistent it is also possible to identify estimates of the true values which are independent of the prediction system these values can then be used to assess the predictive capability of the prediction system in this paper we use bayesian inference markov chain monte carlo simulation and missing data imputation to develop statistical tests for consistent measurement of subjective ordinal scale attributes
for robots operating in real world environments the ability to deal with dynamic entities such as humans animals vehicles or other robots is of fundamental importance the variability of dynamic objects however is large in general which makes it hard to manually design suitable models for their appearance and dynamics in this paper we present an unsupervised learning approach to this model building problem we describe an exemplar based model for representing the time varying appearance of objects in planar laser scans as well as clustering procedure that builds set of object classes from given observation sequences extensive experiments in real environments demonstrate that our system is able to autonomously learn useful models for eg pedestrians skaters or cyclists without being provided with external class information
we consider the problem of establishing route and sending packets between source destination pair in ad hoc networks composed of rational selfish nodes whose purpose is to maximize their own utility in order to motivate nodes to follow the protocol specification we use side payments that are made to the forwarding nodes our goal is to design fully distributed algorithm such that node is always better off participating in the protocol execution individual rationality ii node is always better off behaving according to the protocol specification truthfulness iii messages are routed along the most energy efficient least cost path and iv the message complexity is reasonably low we introduce the commit protocol for individually rational truthful and energy efficient routing in ad hoc networks to the best of our knowledge this is the first ad hoc routing protocol with these features commit is based on the vcg payment scheme in conjunction with novel game theoretic technique to achieve truthfulness for the sender node by means of simulation we show that the inevitable economic inefficiency is small as an aside our work demonstrates the advantage of using cross layer approach to solving problems leveraging the existence of an underlying topology control protocol we are able to simplify the design and analysis of our routing protocol and to reduce its message complexity on the other hand our investigation of the routing problem in presence of selfish nodes disclosed new metric under which topology control protocols can be evaluated the cost of cooperation
modern presentation software is still built around interaction metaphors adapted from traditional slide projectors we provide an analysis of the problems in this application genre that presentation authors face and present fly presentation tool that is based on the idea of planar information structures inspired by the natural human thought processes of data chunking association and spatial memory fly explores authoring of presentation documents evaluation of paper prototype showed that the planar ui is easily grasped by users and leads to presentations more closely resembling the information structure of the original content thus providing better authoring support than the slide metaphor our software prototype confirmed these results and outperformed powerpoint in second study for tasks such as prototyping presentations and generating meaningful overviews users reported that this interface helped them better to express their concepts and expressed significant preference for fly over the traditional slide model
we study generalization of the constraint satisfaction problem csp the periodic constraint satisfaction problem an input instance of the periodic csp is finite set of generating constraints over structured variable set that implicitly specifies larger possibly infinite set of constraints the problem is to decide whether or not the larger set of constraints has satisfying assignment this model is natural for studying constraint networks consisting of constraints obeying high degree of regularity or symmetry our main contribution is the identification of two broad polynomial time tractable subclasses of the periodic csp
suppose we are given graph and set of terminals we consider the problem of constructing graph eh that approximately preserves the congestion of every multicommodity flow with endpoints supported in we refer to such graph as flow sparsifier we prove that there exist flow sparsifiers that simultaneously preserve the congestion of all multicommodity flows within an log log log factor where this bound improves to if excludes any fixed minor this is strengthening of previous results which consider the problem of finding graph eh cut sparsifier that approximately preserves the value of minimum cuts separating any partition of the terminals indirectly our result also allows us to give construction for better quality cut sparsifiers and flow sparsifiers thereby we immediately improve all approximation ratios derived using vertex sparsification in we also prove an log log lower bound for how well flow sparsifier can simultaneously approximate the congestion of every multicommodity flow in the original graph the proof of this theorem relies on technique which we refer to as oblivious dual certifcates for proving super constant congestion lower bounds against many multicommodity flows at once our result implies that approximation algorithms for multicommodity flow type problems designed by black box reduction to uniform case on nodes see for examples must incur super constant cost in the approximation ratio

many of today's high level parallel languages support dynamic fine grained parallelism these languages allow the user to expose all the parallelism in the program which is typically of much higher degree than the number of processors hence an efficient scheduling algorithm is required to assign computations to processors at runtime besides having low overheads and good load balancing it is important for the scheduling algorithm to minimize the space usage of the parallel program this paper presents scheduling algorithm that is provably space efficient and time efficient for nested parallel languages in addition to proving the space and time bounds of the parallel schedule generated by the algorithm we demonstrate that it is efficient in practice we have implemented runtime system that uses our algorithm to schedule parallel threads the results of executing parallel programs on this system show that our scheduling algorithm significantly reduces memory usage compared to previous techniques without compromising performance
in this paper we study generalization of standard property testing where the algorithms are required to be more tolerant with respect to objects that do not have but are close to having the property specifically tolerant property testing algorithm is required to accept objects that are close to having given property and reject objects that are far from having for some parameters another related natural extension of standard property testing that we study is distance approximation here the algorithm should output an estimate of the distance of the object to where this estimate is sufficiently close to the true distance of the object to we first formalize the notions of tolerant property testing and distance approximation and discuss the relationship between the two tasks as well as their relationship to standard property testing we then apply these new notions to the study of two problems tolerant testing of clustering and distance approximation for monotonicity we present and analyze algorithms whose query complexity is either polylogarithmic or independent of the size of the input
despite their popularity and importance pointer based programs remain major challenge for program verification in this paper we propose an automated verification system that is concise precise and expressive for ensuring the safety of pointer based programs our approach uses user definable shape predicates to allow programmers to describe wide range of data structures with their associated size properties to support automatic verification we design new entailment checking procedure that can handle well founded inductive predicates using unfold fold reasoning we have proven the soundness and termination of our verification system and have built prototype system
this paper introduces simple real time distributed computing model for message passing systems which reconciles the distributed computing and the real time systems perspective by just replacing instantaneous computing steps with computing steps of non zero duration we obtain model that both facilitates real time scheduling analysis and retains compatibility with classic distributed computing analysis techniques and results we provide general simulations and validity conditions for transforming algorithms from the classic synchronous model to our real time model and vice versa and investigate whether which properties of real systems are inaccurately or even wrongly captured when resorting to zero step time models we revisit the well studied problem of deterministic drift and failure free internal clock synchronization for this purpose and show that no clock synchronization algorithm with constant running time can achieve optimal precision in our real time model since such an algorithm is known for the classic model this is an instance of problem where the standard distributed computing analysis gives too optimistic results we prove that optimal precision is only achievable with algorithms that take time in our model and establish several additional algorithms and lower bounds
advances in microsensor and radio technology will enable small but smart sensors to be deployed for wide range of environmental monitoring applications the low per node cost will allow these wireless networks of sensors and actuators to be densely distributed the nodes in these dense networks will coordinate to perform the distributed sensing and actuation tasks moreover as described in this paper the nodes can also coordinate to exploit the redundancy provided by high density so as to extend overall system lifetime the large number of nodes deployed in these systems will preclude manual configuration and the environmental dynamics will preclude design time preconfiguration therefore nodes will have to self configure to establish topology that provides communication under stringent energy constraints ascent builds on the notion that as density increases only subset of the nodes are necessary to establish routing forwarding backbone in ascent each node assesses its connectivity and adapts its participation in the multihop network topology based on the measured operating region this paper motivates and describes the ascent algorithm and presents analysis simulation and experimental measurements we show that the system achieves linear increase in energy savings as function of the density and the convergence time required in case of node failures while still providing adequate connectivity
an error occurs when software cannot complete requested action as result of some problem with its input configuration or environment high quality error report allows user to understand and correct the problem unfortunately the quality of error reports has been decreasing as software becomes more complex and layered end users take the cryptic error messages given to them by programsand struggle to fix their problems using search engines and support websites developers cannot improve their error messages when they receive an ambiguous or otherwise insufficient error indicator from black box software component we introduce clarify system that improves error reporting by classifying application behavior clarify uses minimally invasive monitoring to generate behavior profile which is summary of the program's execution history machine learning classifier uses the behavior profile to classify the application's behavior thereby enabling more precise error report than the output of the application itself we evaluate prototype clarify system on ambiguous error messages generated by large modern applications like gcc la tex and the linux kernel for performance cost of less than on user applications and on the linux kernel the proto type correctly disambiguates at least of application behaviors that result in ambiguous error reports this accuracy does not degrade significantly with more behaviors clarify classifier for la tex error messages is at most less accurate than classifier for latex error messages finally we show that without any human effort to build classifier clarify can provide nearest neighbor software support where users who experience problem are told about other users who might have had the same problem on average of the users that clarify identifies have experienced the same problem

we survey recent results on wireless networks that are based on analogies with various branches of physics we address among others the problems of optimally arranging the flow of traffic in wireless sensor networks finding minimum cost routes performing load balancing optimizing and analyzing cooperative transmissions calculating the capacity finding routes that avoid bottlenecks and developing distributed anycasting protocols the results are based on establishing analogies between wireless networks and settings from various branches of physics such as electrostatics optics percolation theory diffusion and others many of the results we present hinge on the assumption that the network is massive ie it consists of so many nodes that it can be described in terms of novel macroscopic view the macroscopic view is not as detailed as the standard microscopic one but nevertheless contains enough details to permit meaningful optimization
when meeting someone new the first impression is often influenced by someone's physical appearance and other types of prejudice in this paper we present touchmedare an interactive canvas which aims to provide an experience when meeting new people while preventing visual prejudice and lowering potential thresholds the focus of the designed experience was to stimulate people to get acquainted through the interactive canvas touchmedare consists of flexible opaque canvas which plays music when touched simultaneously from both sides dynamic variation of this bodily contact is reflected through real time adaptations of the musical compositions two redesigns were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated and final version was placed in the lowlands festival as case study evaluation results showed that some explanation was needed for the initial interaction with the installation on the other hand after this initial unfamiliarity passed results showed that making bodily contact through the installation did help people to get acquainted with each other and increased their social interaction
the standard formalism for explaining abstract types is existential quantification while it provides sufficient model for type abstraction in entirely statically typed languages it proves to be too weak for languages enriched with forms of dynamic typing where parametricity is violated as an alternative approach to type abstraction that addresses this shortcoming we present calculus for dynamic type generation it features an explicit construct for generating new type names and relies on coercions for managing abstraction boundaries between generated types and their designated representation sealing is represented as generalized form of these coercions the calculus maintains abstractions dynamically without restricting type analysis
many applications require randomized ordering of input data examples include algorithms for online aggregation data mining and various randomized algorithms most existing work seems to assume that accessing the records from large database in randomized order is not difficult problem however it turns out to be extremely difficult in practice using existing methods randomization is either extremely expensive at the front end as data are loaded or at the back end as data are queried this paper presents simple file structure which supports both efficient online random shuffling of large database as well as efficient online sampling or randomization of the database when it is queried the key innovation of our method is the introduction of small degree of carefully controlled rigorously monitored nonrandomness into the file
moments before the launch of every space vehicle engineering discipline specialists must make critical go no go decision the cost of false positive allowing launch in spite of fault or false negative stopping potentially successful launch can be measured in the tens of millions of dollars not including the cost in morale and other more intangible detriments the aerospace corporation is responsible for providing engineering assessments critical to the go no go decision for every department of defense space vehicle these assessments are made by constantly monitoring streaming telemetry data in the hours before launch we will introduce viztree novel time series visualization tool to aid the aerospace analysts who must make these engineering assessments viztree was developed at the university of california riverside and is unique in that the same tool is used for mining archival data and monitoring incoming live telemetry the use of single tool for both aspects of the task allows natural and intuitive transfer of mined knowledge to the monitoring task our visualization approach works by transforming the time series into symbolic representation and encoding the data in modified suffix tree in which the frequency and other properties of patterns are mapped onto colors and other visual properties we demonstrate the utility of our system by comparing it with state of the art batch algorithms on several real and synthetic datasets
numerous context aware mobile communication systems have emerged for individuals and groups calling for the identification of critical success factors related to the design of such systems at different levels the effective system design cannot be achieved without the understanding of situated user behaviour in using context aware systems drawing on activity theory this article advances cross level but coherent conceptualisations of context awareness as enabled by emerging systems grounded in the activities of using context aware systems these conceptualisations provide implications for system design at individual and group levels in terms of critical success factors including contextualisation interactivity and personalisation
many materials including water plastic and metal have specular surface characteristics specular reflections have commonly been considered nuisance for the recovery of object shape however the way that reflections are distorted across the surface depends crucially on curvature suggesting that they could in fact be useful source of information indeed observers can have vivid impression of shape when an object is perfectly mirrored ie the image contains nothing but specular reflections this leads to the question what are the underlying mechanisms of our visual system to extract this shape information from perfectly mirrored object in this paper we propose biologically motivated recurrent model for the extraction of visual features relevant for the perception of shape information from images of mirrored objects we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the results of computational model simulations and show that bidirectional recurrent information processing leads to better results than pure feedforward processing furthermore we utilize the model output to create rough nonphotorealistic sketch representation of mirrored object which emphasizes image features that are mandatory for shape perception eg occluding contour and regions of high curvature moreover this sketch illustrates that the model generates representation of object features independent of the surrounding scene reflected in the mirrored object
we address the problem of answering conjunctive queries over extended entity relationship schemata which we call eer extended er schemata with is among entities and relationships and cardinality constraints this is common setting in conceptual data modelling where reasoning over incomplete data with respect to knowledge base is required we adopt semantics for eer schemata based on their relational representation we identify wide class of eer schemata for which query answering is tractable in data complexity the crucial condition for tractability is the separability between maximum cardinality constraints represented as key constraints in relational form and the other constraints we provide by means of graph based representation syntactic condition for separability we show that our conditions is not only sufficient but also necessary thus precisely identifying the class of separable schemata we present an algorithm based on query rewriting that is capable of dealing with such eer schemata while achieving tractability we show that further negative constraints can be added to the eer formalism while still keeping query answering tractable we show that our formalism is general enough to properly generalise the most widely adopted knowledge representation languages
we present set of algorithms and an associated display system capable of producing correctly rendered eye contact between three dimensionally transmitted remote participant and group of observers in teleconferencing system the participant's face is scanned in at hz and transmitted in real time to an autostereoscopic horizontal parallax display displaying him or her over more than deg field of view observable to multiple observers to render the geometry with correct perspective we create fast vertex shader based on lookup table for projecting scene vertices to range of subject angles heights and distances we generalize the projection mathematics to arbitrarily shaped display surfaces which allows us to employ curved concave display surface to focus the high speed imagery to individual observers to achieve two way eye contact we capture video from cross polarized camera reflected to the position of the virtual participant's eyes and display this video feed on large screen in front of the real participant replicating the viewpoint of their virtual self to achieve correct vertical perspective we further leverage this image to track the position of each audience member's eyes allowing the display to render correct vertical perspective for each of the viewers around the device the result is one to many teleconferencing system able to reproduce the effects of gaze attention and eye contact generally missing in traditional teleconferencing systems
common deficiency of discretized datasets is that detail beyond the resolution of the dataset has been irrecoverably lost this lack of detail becomes immediately apparent once one attempts to zoom into the dataset and only recovers blur here we describe method that generates the missing detail from any available and plausible high resolution data using texture synthesis since the detail generation process is guided by the underlying image or volume data and is designed to fill in plausible detail in accordance with the coarse structure and properties of the zoomed in neighborhood we refer to our method as constrained texture synthesis regular zooms become semantic zooms where each level of detail stems from data source attuned to that resolution we demonstrate our approach by medical application the visualization of human liver but its principles readily apply to any scenario as long as data at all resolutions are available we will first present viewing application called the virtual microscope and then extend our technique to volumetric viewing
we present new technique that employs support vector machines svms and gaussian mixture densities gmds to create generative discriminative object classification technique using local image features in the past several approaches to fuse the advantages of generative and discriminative approaches were presented often leading to improved robustness and recognition accuracy support vector machines are well known discriminative classification framework but similar to other discriminative approaches suffer from lack of robustness with respect to noise and overfitting gaussian mixtures on the contrary are widely used generative technique we present method to directly fuse both approaches effectively allowing to fully exploit the advantages of both the fusion of svms and gmds is done by representing svms in the framework of gmds without changing the training and without changing the decision boundary the new classifier is evaluated on the pascal voc data additionally we perform experiments on the usps dataset and on four tasks from the uci machine learning repository to obtain additional insights into the properties of the proposed approach it is shown that for the relatively rare cases where svms have problems the combined method outperforms both individual ones
in this paper processor scheduling policies that save processors are introduced and studied in multiprogrammed parallel system processor saving scheduling policy purposefully keeps some of the available processors idle in the presence of work to be done the conditions under which processor saving policies can be more effective than their greedy counterparts ie policies that never leave processors idle in the presence of work to be done are examined sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to application speedup system size coefficient of variation of the applications execution time variability in the arrival process and multiclass workloads analytical simulation and experimental results show that processor saving policies outperform their greedy counterparts under variety of system and workload characteristics

information system engineering has become under increasing pressure to come up with software solutions that endow systems with the agility that is required to evolve in continually changing business and technological environment in this paper we suggest that software engineering has contribution to make in terms of concepts and techniques that have been recently developed for parallel program design and software architectures we show how such mechanisms can be encapsulated in new modelling primitive coordination contract that can be used for extending component based development approaches in order to manage such levels of change
this article provides detailed implementation study on the behavior of web serves that serve static requests where the load fluctuates over time transient overload various external factors are considered including wan delays and losses and different client behavior models we find that performance can be dramatically improved via kernel level modification to the web server to change the scheduling policy at the server from the standard fair processor sharing scheduling to srpt shortest remaining processing time scheduling we find that srpt scheduling induces no penalties in particular throughput is not sacrificed and requests for long files experience only negligibly higher response times under srpt than they did under the original fair scheduling
recent work demonstrates the potential for extracting patterns from users behavior as detected by sensors since there is currently no generalized framework for reasoning about activity aware applications designers can only rely on the existing systems for guidance however these systems often use custom domain specific definition of activity pattern consequently the guidelines designers can extract from individual systems are limited to the specific application domains of those applications in this paper we introduce five high level guidelines or commandments for designing activity aware applications by considering the issues we outlined in this paper designers will be able to avoid common mistakes inherent in designing activity aware applications
cast shadows are an informative cue to the shape of objects they are particularly valuable for discovering object's concavities which are not available from other cues such as occluding boundaries we propose new method for recovering shape from shadows which we call shadow carving given conservative estimate of the volume occupied by an object it is possible to identify and carve away regions of this volume that are inconsistent with the observed pattern of shadows we prove theorem that guarantees that when these regions are carved away from the shape the shape still remains conservative shadow carving overcomes limitations of previous studies on shape from shadows because it is robust with respect to errors in shadows detection and it allows the reconstruction of objects in the round rather than just bas reliefs we propose reconstruction system to recover shape from silhouettes and shadow carving the silhouettes are used to reconstruct the initial conservative estimate of the object's shape and shadow carving is used to carve out the concavities we have simulated our reconstruction system with commercial rendering package to explore the design parameters and assess the accuracy of the reconstruction we have also implemented our reconstruction scheme in table top system and present the results of scanning of several objects
information from which knowledge can be discovered is frequently distributed due to having been recorded at different times or to having arisen from different sources such information is often subject to both imprecision and uncertainty the dempster shafer representation of evidence offers way of representing uncertainty in the presence of imprecision and may therefore be used to provide mechanism for storing imprecise and uncertain information in databases we consider an extended relational data model that allows the imprecision and uncertainty associated with attribute values to be quantified using mass function distribution when query is executed it may be necessary to combine imprecise and uncertain data from distributed sources in order to answer that query mechanism is therefore required both for combining the data and for generating measures of uncertainty to be attached to the imprecise combined data in this paper we provide such mechanism based on aggregation of evidence we show first how this mechanism can be used to resolve inconsistencies and hence provide an essential database capability to perform the operations necessary to respond to queries on imprecise and uncertain data we go on to exploit the aggregation operator in an attribute driven approach to provide information on properties of and patterns in the data this is fundamental to rule discovery and hence such an aggregation operator provides facility that is central requirement in providing distributed information system with the capability to perform the operations necessary for knowledge discovery
one view of computational learning theory is that of learner acquiring the knowledge of teacher we introduce formal model of learning capturing the idea that teachers may have gaps in their knowledge the goal of the learner is still to acquire the knowledge of the teacher but now the learner must also identify the gaps this is the notion of learning from consistently ignorant teacher we consider the impact of knowledge gaps on learning for example monotone dnf and dimensional boxes and show that learning is still possible negatively we show that knowledge gaps make learning conjunctions of horn clauses as hard as learning dnf we also present general results describing when known learning algorithms can be used to obtain learning algorithms using consistently ignorant teacher

this paper proposes new clothing segmentation method using foreground clothing and background non clothing estimation based on the constrained delaunay triangulation cdt without any pre defined clothing model in our method the clothing is extracted by graph cuts where the foreground seeds and background seeds are determined automatically the foreground seeds are found by torso detection based on dominant colors determination and the background seeds are estimated based on cdt with the determined seeds the color distributions of the foreground and background are modeled by gaussian mixture models and filtered by cdt based noise suppression algorithm for more robust and accurate segmentation experimental results show that our clothing segmentation method is able to extract different clothing from static images with variations in backgrounds and lighting conditions

within the context of the relational model general technique for establishing that the translation of view update defined by constant complement is independent of the choice of complement is presented in contrast to previous results the uniqueness is not limited to order based updates those constructed from insertions and deletions nor is it limited to those well behaved complements which define closed update strategies rather the approach is based upon optimizing the change of information in the main schema which the view update entails the only requirement is that the view and its complement together possess property called semantic bijectivity relative to the information measure it is furthermore established that very wide range of views have this property this results formalizes the intuition long observed in examples that it is difficult to find different complements which define distinct but reasonable update strategies

the power of high level languages lies in their abstraction over hardware and software complexity leading to greater security better reliability and lower development costs however opaque abstractions are often show stoppers for systems programmers forcing them to either break the abstraction or more often simply give up and use different language this paper addresses the challenge of opening up high level language to allow practical low level programming without forsaking integrity or performance the contribution of this paper is three fold we draw together common threads in diverse literature we identify framework for extending high level languages for low level programming and we show the power of this approach through concrete case studies our framework leverages just three core ideas extending semantics via intrinsic methods extending types via unboxing and architectural width primitives and controlling semantics via scoped semantic regimes we develop these ideas through the context of rich literature and substantial practical experience we show that they provide the power necessary to implement substantial artifacts such as high performance virtual machine while preserving the software engineering benefits of the host language the time has come for high level low level programming to be taken more seriously more projects now use high level languages for systems programming increasing architectural heterogeneity and parallelism heighten the need for abstraction and new generation of high level languages are under development and ripe to be influenced
collaboration and information sharing between organizations that share common goal is becoming increasingly important effective sharing promotes efficiency and productivity as well as enhances customer service with internet connectivity widely available sharing and access to information is relatively simple to implement however the abundance causes another problem the difficulty of determining where truly useful and relevant information is housed information resources such as data documents multimedia objects and services stored in different agencies need to be easily discovered and shared we propose collaborative semantic and pragmatic annotation environment where resources of each agency can be annotated by users in the government social network this collaborative annotation captures not only the semantics but also the pragmatics of the resources such as who when where how and why the resources are used the benefits of semantic and pragmatic annotation tags will include an ability to filter discover and search new and dynamic as well as hidden resources to navigate between resources in search by traversing semantic relationships and to recommend the most relevant government information distributed over different agencies distributed architecture of tagging system is shown and tag based search is illustrated

debugging refers to the laborious process of finding causes of program failures often such failures are introduced when program undergoes changes and evolves from stable version to new modified version in this paper we propose an automated approach for debugging evolving programs given two programs reference stable program and new modified program and an input that fails on the modified program our approach uses concrete as well as symbolic execution to synthesize new inputs that differ marginally from the failing input in their control flow behavior comparison of the execution traces of the failing input and the new inputs provides critical clues to the root cause of the failure notable feature of our approach is that it handles hard to explain bugs like code missing errors by pointing to the relevant code in the reference program we have implemented our approach in tool called darwin we have conducted experiments with several real life case studies including real world web servers and the libpng library for manipulating png images our experience from these experiments points to the efficacy of darwin in pinpointing bugs moreover while localizing given observable error the new inputs synthesized by darwin can reveal other undiscovered errors
os kernels have been written in weakly typed or non typed programming languages for example therefore it is extremely hard to verify even simple memory safety of the kernels the difficulty could be resolved by writing os kernels in strictly typed programming languages but existing strictly typed languages are not flexible enough to implement important os facilities eg memory management and multi thread management facilities to address the problem we designed and implemented talk new strictly and statically typed assembly language which is flexible enough to implement os facilities and wrote an os kernel with talk in our approach the safety of the kernel can be verified automatically through static type checking at the level of binary executables without source code
existing research has most often relied on simulation and considered the uniform traffic distribution when investigating the performance properties of multicomputer networks eg the torus however there are numerous parallel applications that generate non uniform traffic patterns such as hot spot furthermore much more attention has been paid to capturing the impact of non uniform traffic on network performance resulting in the development of number of analytical models for predicting message latency in the presence of hot spots in the network for instance analytical models have been reported for the adaptively routed torus with uni directional as well as bi directional channels however models for the deterministically routed torus have considered uni directional channels only in an effort to fill in this gap this paper describes an analytical model for the deterministically routed torus with bi directional channels when subjected to hot spot traffic the modelling approach adopted for deterministic routing is totally different from that for adaptive routing due to the inherently different nature of the two types of routing the validity of the model is demonstrated by comparing analytical results against those obtained through extensive simulation experiments
the task of obtaining an optimal set of parameters to fit mixture model has many applications in science and engineering domains and is computationally challenging problem novel algorithm using convolution based smoothing approach to construct hierarchy or family of smoothed log likelihood surfaces is proposed this approach smooths the likelihood function and applies the em algorithm to obtain promising solution on the smoothed surface using the most promising solutions as initial guesses the em algorithm is applied again on the original likelihood though the results are demonstrated using only two levels the method can potentially be applied to any number of levels in the hierarchy theoretical insight demonstrates that the smoothing approach indeed reduces the overall gradient of modified version of the likelihood surface this optimization procedure effectively eliminates extensive searching in non promising regions of the parameter space results on some benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements of the proposed algorithm compared to other approaches empirical results on the reduction in the number of local maxima and improvements in the initialization procedures are provided

in this paper we approach the problem of constructing ensembles of classifiers from the point of view of instance selection instance selection is aimed at obtaining subset of the instances available for training capable of achieving at least the same performance as the whole training set in this way instance selection algorithms try to keep the performance of the classifiers while reducing the number of instances in the training set meanwhile boosting methods construct an ensemble of classifiers iteratively focusing each new member on the most difficult instances by means of biased distribution of the training instances in this work we show how these two methodologies can be combined advantageously we can use instance selection algorithms for boosting using as objective to optimize the training error weighted by the biased distribution of the instances given by the boosting method our method can be considered as boosting by instance selection instance selection has mostly been developed and used for nearest neighbor nn classifiers so as first step our methodology is suited to construct ensembles of nn classifiers constructing ensembles of classifiers by means of instance selection has the important feature of reducing the space complexity of the final ensemble as only subset of the instances is selected for each classifier however the methodology is not restricted to nn classifier other classifiers such as decision trees and support vector machines svms may also benefit from smaller training set as they produce simpler classifiers if an instance selection algorithm is performed before training in the experimental section we show that the proposed approach is able to produce better and simpler ensembles than random subspace method rsm method for nn and standard ensemble methods for and svms
we present an expectation maximization learning algorithm em for estimating the parameters of partially constrained bayesian trees the bayesian trees considered here consist of an unconstrained subtree and set of constrained subtrees in this tree structure constraints are imposed on some of the parameters of the parametrized conditional distributions such that all conditional distributions within the same subtree share the same constraint we propose learning method that uses the unconstrained subtree to guide the process of discovering set of relevant constrained substructures substructure discovery and constraint enforcement are simultaneously accomplished using an em algorithm we show how our tree substructure discovery method can be applied to the problem of learning representative pose models from set of unsegmented video sequences our experiments demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for human motion classification
in multimedia retrieval query is typically interactively refined towards the optimal answers by exploiting user feedback however in existing work in each iteration the refined query is re evaluated this is not only inefficient but fails to exploit the answers that may be common between iterations furthermore it may also take too many iterations to get the optimal answers in this paper we introduce new approach called optrfs optimizing relevance feedback search by query prediction for iterative relevance feedback search optrfs aims to take users to view the optimal results as fast as possible it optimizes relevance feedback search by both shortening the searching time during each iteration and reducing the number of iterations optrfs predicts the potential candidates for the next iteration and maintains this small set for efficient sequential scan by doing so repeated candidate accesses ie random accesses can be saved hence reducing the searching time for the next iteration in addition efficient scan on the overlap before the next search starts also tightens the search space with smaller pruning radius as step forward optrfs also predicts the optimal query which corresponds to optimal answers based on the early executed iterations queries by doing so some intermediate iterations can be saved hence reducing the total number of iterations by taking the correlations among the early executed iterations into consideration optrfs investigates linear regression exponential smoothing and linear exponential smoothing to predict the next refined query so as to decide the overlap of candidates between two consecutive iterations considering the special features of relevance feedback optrfs further introduces adaptive linear exponential smoothing to self adjust the parameters for more accurate prediction we implemented optrfs and our experimental study on real life data sets show that it can reduce the total cost of relevance feedback search significantly some interesting features of relevance feedback search are also discovered and discussed

sensor networks consist of many small sensing devices that monitor an environment and communicate using wireless links the lifetime of these networks is severely curtailed by the limited battery power of the sensors one line of research in sensor network lifetime management has examined sensor selection techniques in which applications judiciously choose which sensors data should be retrieved and are worth the expended energy in the past many ad hoc approaches for sensor selection have been proposed in this paper we argue that sensor selection should be based upon tradeoff between application perceived benefit and energy consumption of the selected sensor setwe propose framework wherein the application can specify the utility of measuring data nearly concurrently at each set of sensors he goal is then to select sequence of sets to measure whose total utility is maximized while not exceeding the available energy alternatively we may look for the most cost effective sensor set maximizing the product of utility and system lifetimethis approach is very generic and permits us to model many applications of sensor networks we proceed to study two important classes of utility functions submodular and supermodular functions we show that the optimum solution for submodular functions can be found in polynomial time while optimizing the costeffectiveness of supermodular functions is np hard for practically important subclass of supermodular functions we present an lp based solution if nodes can send for different amounts of time and show that we can achieve an logn approximation ratio if each node has to send for the same amount of timefinally we study scenarios in which the quality of measurements is naturally expressed in terms of distances from targets we show that the utility based approach is analogous to penalty based approach in those scenarios and present preliminary results on some practically important special cases
while total order broadcast or atomic broadcast primitives have received lot of attention this paper concentrates on total order multicast to multiple groups in the context of asynchronous distributed systems in which processes may suffer crash failures multicast to multiple groups means that each message is sent to subset of the process groups composing the system distinct messages possibly having distinct destination groups total order means that all message deliveries must be totally ordered this paper investigates consensus based approach to solve this problem and proposes corresponding protocol to implement this multicast primitive this protocol is based on two underlying building blocks namely uniform reliable multicast and uniform consensus its design characteristics lie in the two following properties the first one is minimality property more precisely only the sender of message and processes of its destination groups have to participate in the total order multicast of the message the second property is locality property no execution of consensus has to involve processes belonging to distinct groups ie consensus is executed on per group basis this locality property is particularly useful when one is interested in using the total order multicast primitive in large scale distributed systems in addition to correctness proof an improvement that reduces the cost of the protocol is also suggested
as collaboration in virtual environments becomes more object focused and closely coupled the frequency of conflicts in accessing shared objects can increase in addition two kinds of concurrency control surprises become more disruptive to the collaboration undo surprises can occur when previously visible change is undone because of an access conflict intention surprises can happen when concurrent action by remote session changes the structure of shared object at the same perceived time as local access of that object such that the local user might not get what they expect because they have not had time to visually process the change hierarchy of three concurrency control mechanisms is presented in descending order of collaborative surprises which allows the concurrency scheme to be tailored to the tolerance for such surprises one mechanism is semioptimistic the other two are pessimistic designed for peer to peer vitual environments in which several threads have access to the shared scene graph these algorithms are straightforward and relatively simple they can be implemented using and java under windows and unix on both desktop and immersive systems in series of usability experiments the average performance of the most conservative concurrency control mechanism on local lan was found to be quite acceptable

time sequences which are ordered sets of observations have been studied in various database applications in this paper we introduce new class of time sequences where each observation is represented by an interval rather than number such sequences may arise in many situations for instance we may not be able to determine the exact value at time point due to uncertainty or aggregation such observation may be represented better by range of possible values similarity search with interval time sequences as both query and data sequences poses new challenge for research we first address the issue of dis similarity measures for interval time sequences we choose an norm based measure because it effectively quantifies the degree of overlapping and remoteness between two intervals and is invariant irrespective of the position of an interval when it is enclosed within another interval we next propose an efficient indexing technique for fast retrieval of similar interval time sequences from large databases more specifically we propose to extract segment based feature vector for each sequence and to map each feature vector to either point or hyper rectangle in multi dimensional feature space we then show how we can use existing multi dimensional index structures such as the tree for efficient query processing the proposed method guarantees no false dismissals experimental results show that for synthetic and real stock data it is superior to sequential scanning in performance and scales well with the data size

most correlation clustering algorithms rely on principal component analysis pca as correlation analysis tool the correlation of each cluster is learned by applying pca to set of sample points since pca is rather sensitive to outliers if small fraction of these points does not correspond to the correct correlation of the cluster the algorithms are usually misled or even fail to detect the correct results in this paper we evaluate the influence of outliers on pca and propose general framework for increasing the robustness of pca in order to determine the correct correlation of each cluster we further show how our framework can be applied to pca based correlation clustering algorithms thorough experimental evaluation shows the benefit of our framework on several synthetic and real world data sets
existing dram controllers employ rigid non adaptive scheduling and buffer management policies when servicing prefetch requests some controllers treat prefetch requests the same as demand requests others always prioritize demand requests over prefetch requests however none of these rigid policies result in the best performance because they do not take into account the usefulness of prefetch requests if prefetch requests are useless treating prefetches and demands equally can lead to significant performance loss and extra bandwidth consumption in contrast if prefetch requests are useful prioritizing demands over prefetches can hurt performance by reducing dram throughput and delaying the service of useful requests this paper proposes new low cost memory controller called prefetch aware dram controller padc that aims to maximize the benefit of useful prefetches and minimize the harm caused by useless prefetches to accomplish this padc estimates the usefulness of prefetch requests and dynamically adapts its scheduling and buffer management policies based on the estimates the key idea is to adaptively prioritize between demand and prefetch requests and drop useless prefetches to free up memory system resources based on the accuracy of the prefetcher our evaluation shows that padc significantly outperforms previous memory controllers with rigid prefetch handling policies on both single and multi core systems with variety of prefetching algorithms across wide range of multiprogrammed spec cpu workloads it improves system performance by on core system and by on an core system while reducing dram bandwidth consumption by and respectively
most hardware predictors are table based eg two level branch predictors and have exponential size growth in the number of input bits or features eg previous branch outcomes this growth severely limits the amount of predictive information that such predictors can use to avoid exponential growth we introduce the idea of dynamic feature selection for building hardware predictors that can use large amount of predictive information based on this idea we design the dynamic decision tree ddt predictor which exhibits only linear size growth in the number of features our initial evaluation in branch prediction shows that the general purpose ddt using only branch history features is comparable on average to conventional branch predictors opening the door to practically using large numbers of additional features

cluster based replication solutions are an attractive mechanism to provide both high availability and scalability for the database backend within the multi tier information systems of service oriented businesses an important issue that has not yet received sufficient attention is how database replicas that have failed can be reintegrated into the system or how completely new replicas can be added in order to increase the capacity of the system ideally recovery takes place online ie while transaction processing continues at the replicas that are already running in this paper we present complete online recovery solution for database clusters one important issue is to find an efficient way to transfer the data the joining replica needs in this paper we present two data transfer strategies the first transfers the latest copy of each data item the second transfers the updates rejoining replica has missed during its downtime second challenge is to coordinate this transfer with ongoing transaction processing such that the joining node does not miss any updates we present coordination protocol that can be used with postgres replication tool which uses group communication system for replica control we have implemented and compared our transfer solutions against set of parameters and present heuristics which allow an automatic selection of the optimal strategy for given configuration
influence of items on some other items might not be the same as the association between these sets of items many tasks of data analysis are based on expressing influence of items on other items in this paper we introduce the notion of an overall influence of set of items on another set of items we also propose an extension to the notion of overall association between two items in database using the notion of overall influence we have designed two algorithms for influence analysis involving specific items in database as the number of databases increases on yearly basis we have adopted incremental approach in these algorithms experimental results are reported for both synthetic and real world databases
the growing number of information security breaches in electronic and computing systems calls for new design paradigms that consider security as primary design objective this is particularly relevant in the embedded domain where the security solution should be customized to the needs of the target system while considering other design objectives such as cost performance and power due to the increasing complexity and shrinking design cycles of embedded software most embedded systems present host of software vulnerabilities that can be exploited by security attacks many attacks are initiated by causing violation in the properties of data eg integrity privacy access control rules etc associated with trusted program that is executing on the system leading to range of undesirable effectsin this work we develop general framework that provides security assurance against wide class of security attacks our work is based on the observation that program's permissible behaviorwith respect to data accesses can be characterized by certain properties we present hardware software approach wherein such properties can be encoded as data attributes and enforced as security policies during program execution these policies may be application specific eg access control for certain data structures compiler generated eg enforcing that variables are accessed only within their scope or universally applicable to all programs eg disallowing writes to unallocated memory we show how an embedded system architecture can support such policies by enhancing the memory hierarchy to represent the attributes of each datum as security tags that are linked to it through its lifetime and ii adding configurable hardware checker that interprets the semantics of the tags and enforces the desired security policies we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in enforcing various security policies for several embedded benchmarks our experiments in the context of the simplescalar framework demonstrate that the proposed solution ensures run time validation of program data properties with minimal execution time overheads

the artifacts constituting software system often drift apart over time we have developed the software reflexion model technique to help engineers perform various software engineering tasks by exploiting rather than removing the drift between design and implementation more specifically the technique helps an engineer compare artifacts by summarizing where one artifact such as design is consistent with and inconsistent with another artifact such as source the technique can be applied to help software engineer evolve structural mental model of system to the point that it is good enough to be used for reasoning about task at hand the software reflexion model technique has been applied to support variety of tasks including design conformance change assessment and an experimental reengineering of the million lines of code microsoft excel product in this paper we provide formal characterization of the reflexion model technique discuss practical aspects of the approach relate experiences of applying the approach and tools and place the technique into the context of related work
abstraction and slicing are both techniques for reducing the size of the state space to be inspected during verification in this paper we present new model checking procedure for infinite state concurrent systems that interleaves automatic abstraction refinement which splits states according to new predicates obtained by craig interpolation with slicing which removes irrelevant states and transitions from the abstraction the effects of abstraction and slicing complement each other as the refinement progresses the increasing accuracy of the abstract model allows for more precise slice the resulting smaller representation gives room for additional predicates in the abstraction the procedure terminates when an error path in the abstraction can be concretized which proves that the system is erroneous or when the slice becomes empty which proves that the system is correct
compressing the instructions of an embedded program is important for cost sensitive low power control oriented embedded computing number of compression schemes have been proposed to reduce program size however the increased instruction density has an accompanying performance cost because the instructions must be decompressed before execution in this paper we investigate the performance penalty of hardware managed code compression algorithm recently introduced in ibm's powerpc this scheme is the first to combine many previously proposed code compression techniques making it an ideal candidate for study we find that code compression with appropriate hardware optimizations does not have to incur much performance loss furthermore our studies show this holds for architectures with wide range of memory configurations and issue widths surprisingly we find that performance increase over native code is achievable in many situations

password authenticated key exchange pake protocols allow parties to share secret keys in an authentic manner based on an easily memorizable password recently lu and cao proposed three party password authenticated key exchange protocol so called pake based on ideas of the abdalla and pointcheval two party spake extended to three parties pake can be seen to have structure alternative to that of another three party pake protocol pake by abdalla and pointcheval furthermore simple improvement to pake was proposed very recently by chung and ku to resist the kind of attacks that applied to earlier versions of pake in this paper we show that pake falls to unknown key share attacks by any other client and undetectable online dictionary attacks by any adversary the latter attack equally applies to the recently improved pake indeed the provable security approach should be taken when designing pakes and furthermore our results highlight that extra cautions still be exercised when defining models and constructing proofs in this direction
efficient construction of inverted indexes is essential to provision of search over large collections of text data in this article we review the principal approaches to inversion analyze their theoretical cost and present experimental results we identify the drawbacks of existing inversion approaches and propose single pass inversion method that in contrast to previous approaches does not require the complete vocabulary of the indexed collection in main memory can operate within limited resources and does not sacrifice speed with high temporary storage requirements we show that the performance of the single pass approach can be improved by constructing inverted files in segments reducing the cost of disk accesses during inversion of large volumes of data
materialized xpath access control views are commonly used for enforcing access control when access control rules defining materialized xml access control view change the view must be adapted to reflect these changes the process of updating materialized view after its definition changes is referred to as view adaptation while xpath security views have been widely reported in literature the problem of view adaptation for xpath security views has not been addressed view adaptation results in view downtime during which users are denied access to security views to prevent unauthorized access thus efficient view adaptation is important for making xpath security views pragmatic in this work we show how to adapt an xpath access control view incrementally by re using the existing view which reduces computation and communication costs significantly and results in less downtime for the end user empirical evaluations confirm that the incremental view adaptation algorithms presented in this paper are efficient and scalable
class imbalance where the classes in dataset are not represented equally is common occurrence in machine learning classification models built with such datasets are often not practical since most machine learning algorithms would tend to perform poorly on the minority class instances we present unique evolutionary computing based data sampling approach as an effective solution for the class imbalance problem the genetic algorithm based approach evolutionary sampling works as majority undersampling technique where instances from the majority class are selectively removed this preserves the relative integrity of the majority class while maintaining the original minority class group our research prototype evann also implements genetic algorithm based optimization of modeling parameters for the machine learning algorithms considered in our study an extensive empirical investigation involving four real world datasets is performed comparing the proposed approach to other existing data sampling techniques that target the class imbalance problem our results demonstrate that evolutionary sampling both with and without learner optimization performs relatively better than other data sampling techniques detailed coverage of our case studies in this paper lends itself toward empirical replication
high level languages are growing in popularity however decades of software development have produced large libraries of fast time tested meritorious code that are impractical to recreate from scratch cross language bindings can expose low level code to high level languages unfortunately writing bindings by hand is tedious and error prone while mainstream binding generators require extensive manual annotation or fail to offer the language features that users of modern languages have come to expect we present an improved binding generation strategy based on static analysis of unannotated library source code we characterize three high level idioms that are not uniquely expressible in c's low level type system array parameters resource managers and multiple return values we describe suite of interprocedural analyses that recover this high level information and we show how the results can be used in binding generator for the python programming language in experiments with four large libraries we find that our approach avoids the mistakes characteristic of hand written bindings while offering level of python integration unmatched by prior automated approaches among the thousands of functions in the public interfaces of these libraries roughly exhibit the behaviors detected by our static analyses
the ability to predict at compile time the likelihood of particular branch being taken provides valuable information for several optimizations including global instruction scheduling code layout function inlining interprocedural register allocation and many high level optimizations previous attempts at static branch prediction have either used simple heuristics which can be quite inaccurate or put the burden onto the programmer by using execution profiling data or source code hintsthis paper presents new approach to static branch prediction called value range propagation this method tracks the weighted value ranges of variables through program much like constant propagation these value ranges may be either numeric of symbolic in nature branch prediction is then performed by simply consulting the value range of the appropriate variable heuristics are used as fallback for cases where the value range of the variable cannot be determined statically in the process value range propagationsubsumes both constant propagation and copy propagationexperimental results indicate that this approach produces significantly more accurate predictions than the best existing heuristic techniques the value range propagation method can be implemented over any ldquo factored rdquo dataflow representation with static single assignment property such as ssa form or dependence flow graph where the variables have been renamed to achieve single assignment experimental results indicate that the technique maintains the linear runtime behavior of constant propagation experienced in practice

repeated elements are ubiquitous and abundant in both manmade and natural scenes editing such images while preserving the repetitions and their relations is nontrivial due to overlap missing parts deformation across instances illumination variation etc manually enforcing such relations is laborious and error prone we propose novel framework where user scribbles are used to guide detection and extraction of such repeated elements our detection process which is based on novel boundary band method robustly extracts the repetitions along with their deformations the algorithm only considers the shape of the elements and ignores similarity based on color texture etc we then use topological sorting to establish partial depth ordering of overlapping repeated instances missing parts on occluded instances are completed using information from other instances the extracted repeated instances can then be seamlessly edited and manipulated for variety of high level tasks that are otherwise difficult to perform we demonstrate the versatility of our framework on large set of inputs of varying complexity showing applications to image rearrangement edit transfer deformation propagation and instance replacement
we investigate the problem of optimizing the routing performance of virtual network by adding extra random links our asynchronous and distributed algorithm ensures by adding single extra link per node that the resulting network is navigable small world ie in which greedy routing using the distance in the original network computes paths of polylogarithmic length between any pair of nodes with probability previously known small world augmentation processes require the global knowledge of the network and centralized computations which is unrealistic for large decentralized networks our algorithm based on careful multi layer sampling of the nodes and the construction of light overlay network bypasses these limitations for bounded growth graphs ie graphs where for any node and any radius the number of nodes within distance from is at most constant times the number of nodes within distance our augmentation process proceeds with high probability in log log communication rounds with log log messages of size log bits sent per node and requiring only log log bit space in each node where is the number of nodes and the diameter in particular with the only knowledge of original distances greedy routing computes between any pair of nodes in the augmented network path of length at most log log with probability and of expected length log log hence we provide distributed scheme to augment any bounded growth graph into small world with high probability in polylogarithmic time while requiring polylogarithmic memory we consider that the existence of such lightweight process might be first step towards the definition of more general construction process that would validate kleinberg's model as plausible explanation for the small world phenomenon in large real interaction networks
to achieve interoperability modern information systems and commerce applications use mappings to translate data from one representation to another in dynamic environments like the web data sources may change not only their data but also their schemas their semantics and their query capabilities such changes must be reflected in the mappings mappings left inconsistent by schema change have to be detected and updated as large complicated schemas become more prevalent and as data is reused in more applications manually maintaining mappings even simple mappings like view definitions is becoming impractical we present novel framework and tool tomas for automatically adapting mappings as schemas evolve our approach considers not only local changes to schema but also changes that may affect and transform many components of schema we consider comprehensive class of mappings for relational and xml schemas with choice types and nested constraints our algorithm detects mappings affected by structural or constraint change and generates all the rewritings that are consistent with the semantics of the mapped schemas our approach explicitly models mapping choices made by user and maintains these choices whenever possible as the schemas and mappings evolve we describe an implementation of mapping management and adaptation tool based on these ideas and compare it with mapping generation tool

the key notion in service oriented architecture is decoupling clients and providers of service based on an abstract service description which is used by the service broker to point clients to suitable service implementation client then sends service requests directly to the service implementation problem with the current architecture is that it does not provide trustworthy means for clients to specify service brokers to verify and service implementations to prove that certain desired non functional properties are satisfied during service request processing an example of such non functional property is access and persistence restrictions on the data received as part of the service requests in this work we propose an extension of the service oriented architecture that provides these facilities we also discuss prototype implementation of this architecture and report preliminary results that demonstrate the potential practical value of the proposed architecture in real world software applications

dimensionality reduction is an essential data preprocessing technique for large scale and streaming data classification tasks it can be used to improve both the efficiency and the effectiveness of classifiers traditional dimensionality reduction approaches fall into two categories feature extraction and feature selection techniques in the feature extraction category are typically more effective than those in feature selection category however they may break down when processing large scale data sets or data streams due to their high computational complexities similarly the solutions provided by the feature selection approaches are mostly solved by greedy strategies and hence are not ensured to be optimal according to optimized criteria in this paper we give an overview of the popularly used feature extraction and selection algorithms under unified framework moreover we propose two novel dimensionality reduction algorithms based on the orthogonal centroid algorithm oc the first is an incremental oc ioc algorithm for feature extraction the second algorithm is an orthogonal centroid feature selection ocfs method which can provide optimal solutions according to the oc criterion both are designed under the same optimization criterion experiments on reuters corpus volume data set and some public large scale text data sets indicate that the two algorithms are favorable in terms of their effectiveness and efficiency when compared with other state of the art algorithms

abstract almost all semantics for logic programs with negation identify set sem of models of program as the intended semantics of and any model in this class is considered possible meaning of with regard to the semantics the user has in mind thus for example in the case of stable models check end of sentence choice models check end of sentence answer sets check end of sentence etc different possible models correspond to different ways of completing the incomplete information in the logic program however different end users may have different ideas on which of these different models in sem is reasonable one from their point of view for instance given sem user may prefer model in sem to model in sem based on some evaluation criterion that she has in this paper we develop logic program semantics based on optimal models this semantics does not add yet another semantics to the logic programming arena it takes as input an existing semantics sem and user specified objective function obj and yields new semantics underline rm opt subseteq sem that realizes the objective function within the framework of preferred models identified already by sem thus the user who may or may not know anything about logic programming has considerable flexibility in making the system reflect her own objectives by building on top of existing semantics known to the system in addition to the declarative semantics we provide complete complexity analysis and algorithms to compute optimal models under varied conditions when sem is the stable model semantics the minimal models semantics and the all models semantics
the growing nature of databases and the flexibility inherent in the sql query language that allows arbitrarily complex formulations can result in queries that take inordinate amount of time to complete to mitigate this problem strategies that are optimized to return the first few rows or top rows in case of sorted results are usually employed however both these strategies can lead to unpredictable query processing times thus in this paper we propose supporting time constrained sql queries specifically user issues sql query as before but additionally provides nature of constraint soft or hard an upper bound for query processing time and acceptable nature of results partial or approximate the dbms takes the criteria constraint type time limit quality of result into account in generating the query execution plan which is expected guaranteed to complete in the allocated time for soft hard time constraint if partial results are acceptable then the technique of reducing result set cardinality ie returning first few or top rows is used whereas if approximate results are acceptable then sampling is used to compute query results within the specified time limit for the latter case we argue that trading off quality of results for predictable response time is quite useful however for this case we provide additional aggregate functions to estimate the aggregate values and to compute the associated confidence interval this paper presents the notion of time constrained sql queries discusses the challenges in supporting such construct describes framework for supporting such queries and outlines its implementation in oracle database by exploiting oracle's cost based optimizer and extensibility capabilities

the evolution of geographic phenomena has been one of the concerns of spatiotemporal database research however in large spectrum of geographical applications users need more than mere representation of data evolution for instance in urban management applications mdash eg cadastral evolution mdash users often need to know why how and by whom certain changes have been performed as well as their possible impact on the environment answers to such queries are not possible unless supplementary information concerning real world events is associated with the corresponding changes in the database and is managed efficiently this paper proposes solution to this problem which is based on extending spatiotemporal database with mechanism for managing documentation on the evolution of geographic information this solution has been implemented in gis based prototype which is also discussed in the paper

in recent years classification learning for data streams has become an important and active research topic major challenge posed by data streams is that their underlying concepts can change over time which requires current classifiers to be revised accordingly and timely to detect concept change common methodology is to observe the online classification accuracy if accuracy drops below some threshold value concept change is deemed to have taken place an implicit assumption behind this methodology is that any drop in classification accuracy can be interpreted as symptom of concept change unfortunately however this assumption is often violated in the real world where data streams carry noise that can also introduce significant reduction in classification accuracy to compound this problem traditional noise cleansing methods are incompetent for data streams those methods normally need to scan data multiple times whereas learning for data streams can only afford one pass scan because of data's high speed and huge volume another open problem in data stream classification is how to deal with missing values when new instances containing missing values arrive how learning model classifies them and how the learning model updates itself according to them is an issue whose solution is far from being explored to solve these problems this paper proposes novel classification algorithm flexible decision tree flexdt which extends fuzzy logic to data stream classification the advantages are three fold first flexdt offers flexible structure to effectively and efficiently handle concept change second flexdt is robust to noise hence it can prevent noise from interfering with classification accuracy and accuracy drop can be safely attributed to concept change third it deals with missing values in an elegant way extensive evaluations are conducted to compare flexdt with representative existing data stream classification algorithms using large suite of data streams and various statistical tests experimental results suggest that flexdt offers significant benefit to data stream classification in real world scenarios where concept change noise and missing values coexist

the problem confronted in the content based image retrieval research is the semantic gap between the low level feature representing and high level semantics in the images this paper describes way to bridge such gap by learning the similar images given from the user the system extracts the similar region pairs and classifies those similar region pairs either as object or non object semantics and either as object relation or non object relation semantics automatically which are obtained from comparing the distances and spatial relationships in the similar region pairs by themselves the system also extracts interesting parts of the features from the similar region pair and then adjusts each interesting feature and region pair weight dynamically using those objects and object relation semantics as well as the dynamic weights adjustment from the similar images the semantics of those similar images can be mined and used for searching the similar images the experiments show that the proposed system can retrieve the similar images well and efficient
in this paper some studies have been made on the essence of fuzzy linear discriminant analysis lda algorithm and fuzzy support vector machine fsvm classifier respectively as kernel based learning machine fsvm is represented with the fuzzy membership function while realizing the same classification results with that of the conventional pair wise classification it outperforms other learning machines especially when unclassifiable regions still remain in those conventional classifiers however serious drawback of fsvm is that the computation requirement increases rapidly with the increase of the number of classes and training sample size to address this problem an improved fsvm method that combines the advantages of fsvm and decision tree called dt fsvm is proposed firstly furthermore in the process of feature extraction reformative lda algorithm based on the fuzzy nearest neighbors fknn is implemented to achieve the distribution information of each original sample represented with fuzzy membership grade which is incorporated into the redefinition of the scatter matrices in particular considering the fact that the outlier samples in the patterns may have some adverse influence on the classification result we developed novel lda algorithm using relaxed normalized condition in the definition of fuzzy membership function thus the classification limitation from the outlier samples is effectively alleviated finally by making full use of the fuzzy set theory complete lda cf lda framework is developed by combining the reformative lda rf lda feature extraction method and dt fsvm classifier this hybrid fuzzy algorithm is applied to the face recognition problem extensive experimental studies conducted on the orl and nust face images databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
the region analysis of tofte and talpin is an attempt to determine statically the life span of dynamically allocated objects but the calculus is at once intuitively simple yet deceptively subtle and previous theoretical analyses have been frustratingly complex no analysis has revealed and explained in simple terms the connection between the subleties of the calculus and the imperative features it builds on we present novel approach for proving safety and correctness of simplified version of the region calculus we give stratified operational semantics composed of highlevel semantics dealing with the conceptual difficulties of effect annotations and low level one with explicit operations on region indexed store the main results of the paper are proof simpler than previous ones and modular approach to type safety and correctness the flexibility of this approach is demonstrated by the simplicity of the extension to the full calculus with type and region polymorphism
ontologies enable to directly encode domain knowledge in software applications so ontology based systems can exploit the meaning of information for providing advanced and intelligent functionalities one of the most interesting and promising application of ontologies is information extraction from unstructured documents in this area the extraction of meaningful information from pdf documents has been recently recognized as an important and challenging problem this paper proposes an ontology based information extraction system for pdf documents founded on well suited knowledge representation approach named self populating ontology spo the spo approach combines object oriented logic based features with formal grammar capabilities and allows expressing knowledge in term of ontology schemas instances and extraction rules called descriptors aimed at extracting information having also tabular form the novel aspect of the spo approach is that it allows to represent ontologies enriched by rules that enable them to populate them self with instances extracted from unstructured pdf documents in the paper the tractability of the spo approach is proven moreover features and behavior of the prototypical implementation of the spo system are illustrated by means of running example
using wireless peer to peer interactions between portable devices it is possible to locally share information and maintain spatial temporal knowledge emanating from the surroundings we consider the prospects for unleashing ambient data from the surrounding environment for information provision using two biological phenomena human mobility and human social interaction this leads to analogies with epidemiology and is highly relevant to future technology rich environments here embedded devices in the physical environment such as sensors and wireless enabled appliances represent information sources that can provide extensive situated information in this paper we address candidate scenario where isolated sensors in the environment provide real time data from fixed locations using simulation we examine what happens when information is greedily acquired and shared by mobile participants through peer to peer interaction this is assessed taking into account availability of source nodes and the effects of mobility with respect to temporal accuracy of information the results reaffirm the need to consider range of mobility models in testing and validating protocols
we study adding aggregate operators such as summing up elements of column of relation to logics with counting mechanisms the primary motivation comes from database applications where aggregate operators are present in all real life query languages unlike other features of query languages aggregates are not adequately captured by the existing logical formalisms consequently all previous approaches to analyzing the expressive power of aggregation were only capable of producing partial results depending on the allowed class of aggregate and arithmetic operationswe consider powerful counting logic and extend it with the set of all aggregate operators we show that the resulting logic satisfies analogs of hanf's and gaifman's theorems meaning that it can only express local properties we consider database query language that expresses all the standard aggregates found in commercial query languages and show how it can be translated into the aggregate logic thereby providing number of expressivity bounds that do not depend on particular class of arithmetic functions and that subsume all those previously known we consider restricted aggregate logic that gives us tighter capture of database languages and also use it to show that some questions on expressivity of aggregation cannot be answered without resolving some deep problems in complexity theory
while there have been advances in visualization systems particularly in multi view visualizations and visual exploration the process of building visualizations remains major bottleneck in data exploration we show that provenance metadata collected during the creation of pipelines can be reused to suggest similar content in related visualizations and guide semi automated changes we introduce the idea of query by example in the context of an ensemble of visualizations and the use of analogies as first class operations in system to guide scalable interactions we describe an implementation of these techniques in vistrails publicly available open source system
since the first results published in by liu and layland on the rate monotonic rm and earliest deadline first edf algorithms lot of progress has been made in the schedulability analysis of periodic task sets unfortunately many misconceptions still exist about the properties of these two scheduling methods which usually tend to favor rm more than edf typical wrong statements often heard in technical conferences and even in research papers claim that rm is easier to analyze than edf it introduces less runtime overhead it is more predictable in overload conditions and causes less jitter in task executionsince the above statements are either wrong or not precise it is time to clarify these issues in systematic fashion because the use of edf allows better exploitation of the available resources and significantly improves system's performancethis paper compares rm against edf under several aspects using existing theoretical results specific simulation experiments or simple counterexamples to show that many common beliefs are either false or only restricted to specific situations

sprint is middleware infrastructure for high performance and high availability data management it extends the functionality of standalone in memory database imdb server to cluster of commodity shared nothing servers applications accessing an imdb are typically limited by the memory capacity of the machine running the imdb sprint partitions and replicates the database into segments and stores them in several data servers applications are then limited by the aggregated memory of the machines in the cluster transaction synchronization and commitment rely on total order multicast differently from previous approaches sprint does not require accurate failure detection to ensure strong consistency allowing fast reaction to failures experiments conducted on cluster with data servers using tpc and micro benchmark showed that sprint can provide very good performance and scalability
the effort in software process support has focused so far on modeling and enacting processes certain amount of work has been done but little has reached satisfactory level of maturity and acceptance in our opinion this is due to the difficulty for system to accommodate the very numerous aspects involved in software processes complete process support should cover topics ranging from low level tasks like compiling to organizational and strategic tasks this includes process enhancement resource management and control cooperative work etc the environment must also be convenient for software engineers team leaders managers and so on it must be able to describe details for efficient execution and be high level for capturing understanding etc as matter of fact the few tools that have reached sufficient maturity have focussed on single topic and addressed single class of usersit is our claim that no single system can provide satisfactory solution except in clearly defined subdomain thus we shifted our attention from finding the universal system to finding ways to make many different systems cooperate with their associated formalisms and process enginesthis paper presents novel approach for software process support environments based on federation of heterogeneous and autonomous components the approach has been implemented and experimented in the apel environment it is shown which architecture and technology is involved how it works which interoperability paradigms have been used which problems we have solved and which issues are still under study
as the internet grows in size it becomes crucial to understand how the speeds of links in the network must improve in order to sustain the pressure of new end nodes being added each day although the speeds of links in the core and at the edges improve roughly according to moore's law this improvement alone might not be enough indeed the structure of the internet graph and routing in the network might necessitate much faster improvements in the speeds of key links in the network in this paper using combination of analysis and extensive simulations we show that the worst congestion in the internet as level graph in fact scales poorly with the network size sup omega sup where is the number of nodes when shortest path routing is used to route traffic between ases we also show somewhat surprisingly that policy based routing does not exacerbate the maximum congestion when compared to shortest path routing our results show that it is crucial to identify ways to alleviate this congestion to avoid some links from being perpetually congested to this end we show that the congestion scaling properties of internet like graphs can be improved dramatically by introducing moderate amounts of redundancy in the graph in terms of parallel edges between pairs of adjacent nodes
challenge involved in applying density based clustering to categorical biomedical data is that the cube of attribute values has no ordering defined making the search for dense subspaces slow we propose the hierdenc algorithm for hierarchical density based clustering of categorical data and complementary index for searching for dense subspaces efficiently the hierdenc index is updated when new objects are introduced such that clustering does not need to be repeated on all objects the updating and cluster retrieval are efficient comparisons with several other clustering algorithms showed that on large datasets hierdenc achieved better runtime scalability on the number of objects as well as cluster quality by fast collapsing the bicliques in large networks we achieved an edge reduction of as much as hierdenc is suitable for large and quickly growing datasets since it is independent of object ordering does not require re clustering when new data emerges and requires no user specified input parameters
this paper surveys how the maximum adjacency ma ordering of the vertices in graph can be used to solve various graph problems we first explain that the minimum cut problem can be solved efficiently by utilizing the ma ordering the idea is then extended to fundamental operation of graph edge splitting based on this the edge connectivity augmentation problem for given and also for the entire range of can be solved efficiently by making use of the ma ordering where it is asked to add the smallest number of new edges to given graph so that its edge connectivity is increased to other related topics are also surveyed
this paper examines algorithmic aspects of searching for approximate functional dependencies in database relation the goal is to avoid exploration of large parts of the space of potential rules this is accomplished by leveraging found rules to make finding other rules more efficient the overall strategy is an attribute at time iteration which uses local breadth first searches on lattices that increase in width and height in each iteration the resulting algorithm provides many opportunities to apply heuristics to tune the search for particular data sets and or search objectives the search can be tuned at both the global iteration level and the local search level number of heuristics are developed and compared experimentally
current recommender systems attempt to identify appealing items for user by applying syntactic matching techniques which suffer from significant limitations that reduce the quality of the offered suggestions to overcome this drawback we have developed domain independent personalization strategy that borrows reasoning techniques from the semantic web elaborating recommendations based on the semantic relationships inferred between the user's preferences and the available items our reasoning based approach improves the quality of the suggestions offered by the current personalization approaches and greatly reduces their most severe limitations to validate these claims we have carried out case study in the digital tv field in which our strategy selects tv programs interesting for the viewers from among the myriad of contents available in the digital streams our experimental evaluation compares the traditional approaches with our proposal in terms of both the number of tv programs suggested and the users perception of the recommendations finally we discuss concerns related to computational feasibility and scalability of our approach

the tremendous growth of system memories has increased the capacities and capabilities of memory resident embedded databases yet current embedded databases need to be tuned in order to take advantage of new memory technologies in this paper we study the implications of hosting memory resident databases and propose hardware and software query driven techniques to improve their performance and energy consumption we exploit the structured organization of memories which enables selective mode of operation in which banks are accessed selectively unused banks are placed in lower power mode based on access pattern information we propose hardware techniques that dynamically control the memory by making the system adapt to the access patterns that arise from queries we also propose software query directed scheme that directly modifies the queries to reduce the energy consumption by ensuring uniform bank accesses our results show that these optimizations could lead to at the least reduction in memory energy we also show that query directed schemes better utilize the low power modes achieving up to improvement
modern database systems provide not only powerful data models but also complex query languages supporting powerful features such as the ability to create new database objects and invocation of arbitrary methods possibly written in third party programming language in this sense query languages have evolved into powerful programming languages surprisingly little work exists utilizing techniques from programming language research to specify and analyse these query languages this paper provides formal high level operational semantics for complex value oql like query language that can create fresh database objects and invoke external methods we define type system for our query language and prove an important soundness propertywe define simple effect typing discipline to delimit the computational effects within our queries we prove that this effect system is correct and show how it can be used to detect cases of non determinism and to define correct query optimizations

there has been tremendous growth in the amount and range of information available on the internet the users requests for online information can be captured by long tail model few popular websites enjoy high number of visitations while the majority of the rest are less frequently requested in this study we use real world data to investigate this phenomenon and show that both users physical location and time of access affect the heterogeneity of website requests the effect can partially be explained by differences in demographic characteristics at locations and diverse user browsing behavior in weekdays and weekends these results can be used to design better online marketing strategies affiliate advertising models and internet caching algorithms with sensitivities to user location and time of access differences
leakage energy reduction for caches has been the target of many recent research efforts in this work we propose novel compiler directed approach to reduce the data cache leakage energy by exploiting the program behavior the proposed approach is based on the observation that only small portion of the data are active at runtime and the program spends lot of time in loops so large portion of data cache lines which are not accessed by the loop can be placed into the leakage control mode to reduce leakage energy consumption the compiler directed approach does not require hardware counters to monitor the access patterns of the cache lines and it is adaptive to the program behavior the experimental results show that the compiler directed approach is very competitive in terms of energy consumption and energy delay product compared to the recently proposed pure hardware based approach we also show that the utilization of loop transformations can increase the effectiveness of our strategy

new paradigm for mobile service chain's competitive and collaborative mechanism is proposed in this study the main idea of the proposed approach is based on multi agent system with optimal profit of the pull push and collaborative models among the portal access service provider pasp the product service provider psp and the mobile service provider msp to address the running mechanism for the multi agent system an integrated system framework is proposed based on the agent evolution algorithm aea which could resolve all these modes to examine the feasibility of the framework prototype system based on java repast is implemented the simulation experiments show that this system can help decision makers take the appropriate strategies with higher profits by analyzing the expectations and variances or risks of each player's profit the interaction between and among entities in the chain is well understood it is found that in the situation where collaborative mechanism is applied the performance of players is better as compared to the other two situations where competitive mechanism is implemented if some constraints are applied the risk will be kept at low level
the common abstraction of xml schema by unranked regular tree languages is not entirely accurate to shed some light on the actual expressive power of xml schema intuitive semantical characterizations of the element declarations consistent edc rule are provided in particular it is obtained that schemas satisfying edc can only reason about regular properties of ancestors of nodes hence with respect to expressive power xml schema is closer to dtds than to tree automata these theoretical results are complemented with an investigation of the xml schema definitions xsds occurring in practice revealing that the extra expressiveness of xsds over dtds is only used to very limited extent as this might be due to the complexity of the xml schema specification and the difficulty of understanding the effect of constraints on typing and validation of schemas simpler formalism equivalent to xsds is proposed it is based on contextual patterns rather than on recursive types and it might serve as light weight front end for xml schema next the effect of edc on the way xml documents can be typed is discussed it is argued that cleaner more robust larger but equally feasible class is obtained by replacing edc with the notion of pass preorder typing ppt schemas that allow one to determine the type of an element of streaming document when its opening tag is met this notion can be defined in terms of grammars with restrained competition regular expressions and there is again an equivalent syntactical formalism based on contextual patterns finally algorithms for recognition simplification and inclusion of schemas for the various classes are given
we propose method to handle approximate searching by image content in medical image databases image content is represented by attributed relational graphs holding features of objects and relationships between objects the method relies on the assumption that fixed number of labeled or expected objects eg heart lungs etc are common in all images of given application domain in addition to variable number of unexpected or unlabeled objects eg tumor hematoma etc the method can answer queries by example such as find all rays that are similar to smith's ray the stored images are mapped to points in multidimensional space and are indexed using state of the art database methods trees the proposed method has several desirable propertiesdatabase search is approximate so that all images up to prespecified degree of similarity tolerance are retrievedit has no false dismissals ie all images qualifying query selection criteria are retrieved it is much faster than sequential scanning for searching in the main memory and on the disk ie by up to an order of magnitude thus scaling up well for large databases
this paper proposes novel method using constant inter frame motion for self calibration from an image sequence of an object rotating around single axis with varying camera internal parameters our approach makes use of the facts that in many commercial systems rotation angles are often controlled by an electromechanical system and that the inter frame essential matrices are invariant if the rotation angles are constant but not necessary known therefore recovering camera internal parameters is possible by making use of the equivalence of essential matrices which relate the unknown calibration matrices to the fundamental matrices computed from the point correspondences we also describe linear method that works under restrictive conditions on camera internal parameters the solution of which can be used as the starting point of the iterative non linear method with looser constraints the results are refined by enforcing the global constraints that the projected trajectory of any point should be conic after compensating for the focusing and zooming effects finally using the bundle adjustment method tailored to the special case ie static camera and constant object rotation the structure of the object is recovered and the camera parameters are further refined simultaneously to determine the accuracy and the robustness of the proposed algorithm we present the results on both synthetic and real sequences

in this paper we analyze the node spatial distribution of mobile wireless ad hoc networks characterizing this distribution is of fundamental importance in the analysis of many relevant properties of mobile ad hoc networks such as connectivity average route length and network capacity in particular we have investigated under what conditions the node spatial distribution resulting after large number of mobility steps resembles the uniform distribution this is motivated by the fact that the existing theoretical results concerning mobile ad hoc networks are based on this assumption in order to test this hypothesis we performed extensive simulations using two well known mobility models the random waypoint model which resembles intentional movement and brownian like model which resembles nonintentional movement our analysis has shown that in brownian like motion the uniformity assumption does hold and that the intensity of the concentration of nodes in the center of the deployment region that occurs in the random waypoint model heavily depends on the choice of some mobility parameters for extreme values of these parameters the uniformity assumption is impaired

weak pseudorandom function wprf is cryptographic primitive similar to but weaker than pseudorandom function for wprfs one only requires that the output is pseudorandom when queried on random inputs we show that unlike normal prfs wprfs are seed incompressible in the sense that the output of wprf is pseudorandom even if bounded amount of information about the key is leakedas an application of this result we construct simple mode of operation which when instantiated with any wprf gives leakage resilient stream cipher the implementation of such cipher is secure against every side channel attack as long as the amount of information leaked per round is bounded but overall can be arbitrary large the construction is simpler than the previous one dziembowski pietrzak focs as it only uses single primitive wprf in straight forward manner

the main goal of this paper is to provide routing table free online algorithms for wireless sensor networks wsns to select cost eg node residual energies and delay efficient paths as basic information to drive the routing process both node costs and hop count distances are considered particular emphasis is given to greedy routing schemes due to their suitability for resource constrained and highly dynamic networks for what concerns greedy forwarding we present the statistically assisted routing algorithm sara where forwarding decisions are driven by statistical information on the costs of the nodes within coverage and in the second order neighborhood by analysis we prove that an optimal online policy exists we derive its form and we exploit it as the core of sara besides greedy techniques sub optimal algorithms where node costs can be partially propagated through the network are also presented these techniques are based on real time learning lrta algorithms which through an initial exploratory phase converge to quasi globally optimal paths all the proposed schemes are then compared by simulation against globally optimal solutions discussing the involved trade offs and possible performance gains the results show that the exploitation of second order cost information in sara substantially increases the goodness of the selected paths with respect to fully localized greedy routing finally the path quality can be further increased by lrta schemes whose convergence can be considerably enhanced by properly setting real time search parameters however these solutions fail in highly dynamic scenarios as they are unable to adapt the search process to time varying costs

commercial workloads form an important class of applications and have performance characteristics that are distinct from scientific and technical benchmarks such as spec cpu however due to the prohibitive simulation time of commercial workloads it is extremely difficult to use them in computer architecture research in this paper we study the efficacy of using statistical sampling based simulation methodology for two classes of commercial workloads java server benchmark specjbb and an online transaction processing oltp benchmark dbt our results show that although specjbb shows distinct garbage collection phases there are no large scale phases in the oltp benchmark we take advantage of this stationary behavior in steady phase and propose statistical sampling based simulation technique dynasim with two dynamic stopping rules in this approach the simulation terminates once the target accuracy has been met we apply dynasim to simulate commercial workloads and show that with the simulation of only few million total instructions the error can be within at confidence level of dynasim compares favorably with random sampling and representative sampling in terms of the total number of instructions simulated time cost and with representative sampling in terms of the number of checkpoints storage cost dynasim increases the usability of sampling based simulation approach for commercial workloads and will encourage the use of commercial workloads in computer architecture research
we describe new data format for storing triangular symmetric and hermitian matrices called rectangular full packed format rfpf the standard two dimensional arrays of fortran and also known as full format that are used to represent triangular and symmetric matrices waste nearly half of the storage space but provide high performance via the use of level blas standard packed format arrays fully utilize storage array space but provide low performance as there is no level packed blas we combine the good features of packed and full storage using rfpf to obtain high performance via using level blas as rfpf is standard full format representation also rfpf requires exactly the same minimal storage as packed the format each lapack full and or packed triangular symmetric and hermitian routine becomes single new rfpf routine based on eight possible data layouts of rfpf this new rfpf routine usually consists of two calls to the corresponding lapack full format routine and two calls to level blas routines this means no new software is required as examples we present lapack routines for cholesky factorization cholesky solution and cholesky inverse computation in rfpf to illustrate this new work and to describe its performance on several commonly used computer platforms performance of lapack full routines using rfpf versus lapack full routines using the standard format for both serial and smp parallel processing is about the same while using half the storage performance gains are roughly one to factor of for serial and one to factor of for smp parallel times faster using vendor lapack full routines with rfpf than with using vendor and or reference packed routines
application resource usage models can be used in the decision making process for ensuring quality of service as well as for capacity planning apart from their general use in performance modeling optimization and systems management current solutions for modeling application resource usage tend to address parts of the problem by either focusing on specific application or specific platform or on small subset of system resources we propose simple and flexible approach for modeling application resource usage in platform independent manner that enables the prediction of application resource usage on unseen platforms the technique proposed is application agnostic requiring no modification to the application binary or source and no knowledge of application semantics we implement linux based prototype and evaluate it using four different workloads including real world applications and benchmarks our experiments reveal prediction errors that are bound within of the observed for these workloads when using the proposed approach
similarity search is core module of many data analysis tasks including search by example classification and clustering for time series data dynamic time warping dtw has been proven very effective similarity measure since it minimizes the effects of shifting and distortion in time however the quadratic cost of dtw computation to the length of the matched sequences makes its direct application on databases of long time series very expensive we propose technique that decomposes the sequences into number of segments and uses cheap approximations thereof to compute fast lower bounds for their warping distances we present several progressively tighter bounds relying on the existence or not of warping constraints finally we develop an index and multi step technique that uses the proposed bounds and performs two levels of filtering to efficiently process similarity queries thorough experimental study suggests that our method consistently outperforms state of the art methods for dtw similarity search
various known models of probabilistic xml can be represented as instantiations of the abstract notion of documents in addition to ordinary nodes documents have distributional nodes that specify the possible worlds and their probabilistic distribution particular families of documents are determined by the types of distributional nodes that can be used as well as by the structural constraints on the placement of those nodes in document some of the resulting families provide natural extensions and combinations of previously studied probabilistic xml models the focus of the paper is on the expressive power of families of documents in particular two main issues are studied the first is the ability to efficiently translate given document of one family into another family the second is closure under updates namely the ability to efficiently represent the result of updating the instances of document of given family as another document of that family for both issues we distinguish two variants corresponding to value based and object based semantics of documents
we discuss the parallelization of algorithms for solving poly nomial systems symbolically by way of triangular decompositions we introduce component level parallelism for which the number of processors in use depends on the geometry of the solution set of the input system our long term goal is to achieve an efficient multi level parallelism coarse grained component level for tasks computing geometric objects in the solution sets and medium fine grained level for polynomial arithmetic such as gcd resultant computation within each task component level parallelization of triangular decompositions belongs to the class of dynamic irregular parallel applications which leads us to address the following question how to exploit geometrical information at an early stage of the solving process that would be favorable to parallelization we report on the effectiveness of the approaches that we have applied including modular methods solving by decreasing order of dimension task pool with dimension and rank guided scheduling we have extended the aldor programming language to support multiprocessed parallelism on smps and realized preliminary implementation our experimentation shows promising speedups for some well known problems and proves that our component level parallelization is practically efficient we expect that this speedup would add multiplicative factor to the speedup of medium fine grained level parallelization as parallel gcd and resultant computations
transactional coherence and consistency tcc offers way to simplify parallel programming by executing all code within transactions in tcc systems transactions serve as the fundamental unit of parallel work communication and coherence as each transaction completes it writes all of its newly produced state to shared memory atomically while restarting other processors that have speculatively read stale data with this mechanism tcc based system automatically handles data synchronization correctly without programmer intervention to gain the benefits of tcc programs must be decomposed into transactions we describe two basic programming language constructs for decomposing programs into transactions loop conversion syntax and general transaction forking mechanism with these constructs writing correct parallel programs requires only small incremental changes to correct sequential programs the performance of these programs may then easily be optimized based on feedback from real program execution using few simple techniques
modern stream applications such as sensor monitoring systems and publish subscription services necessitate the handling of large numbers of continuous queries specified over high volume data streams efficient sharing of computations among multiple continuous queries especially for the memory and cpu intensive window based operations is critical novel challenge in this scenario is to allow resource sharing among similar queries even if they employ windows of different lengths this paper first reviews the existing sharing methods in the literature and then illustrates the significant performance shortcomings of these methodsthis paper then presents novel paradigm for the sharing of window join queries namely we slice window states of join operator into fine grained window slices and form chain of sliced window joins by using an elaborate pipelining methodology the number of joins after state slicing is reduced from quadratic to linear this novel sharing paradigm enables us to push selections down into the chain and flexibly select subsequences of such sliced window joins for computation sharing among queries with different window sizes based on the state slice sharing paradigm two algorithms are proposed for the chain buildup one minimizes the memory consumption while the other minimizes the cpu usage the algorithms are proven to find the optimal chain with respect to memory or cpu usage for given query workload we have implemented the slice share paradigm within the data stream management system cape the experimental results show that our strategy provides the best performance over diverse range of workload settings among all alternate solutions in the literature
in ad hoc networks the performance is significantly degraded as the size of the network grows the network clustering by which the nodes are hierarchically organized on the basis of the proximity relieves this performance degradation finding the weakly connected dominating set wcds is promising approach for clustering the wireless ad hoc networks finding the minimum wcds in the unit disk graph is an np hard problem and host of approximation algorithms has been proposed in this article we first proposed centralized approximation algorithm called dla cc based on distributed learning automata dla for finding near optimal solution to the minimum wcds problem then we propose dla based clustering algorithm called dla dc for clustering the wireless ad hoc networks the proposed cluster formation algorithm is distributed implementation of dla cc in which the dominator nodes and their closed neighbors assume the role of the cluster heads and cluster members respectively in this article we compute the worst case running time and message complexity of the clustering algorithm for finding near optimal cluster head set we argue that by proper choice of the learning rate of the clustering algorithm trade off between the running time and message complexity of algorithm with the cluster head set size clustering optimality can be made the simulation results show the superiority of the proposed algorithms over the existing methods
traditional compilers compile and optimize files separately making worst case assumptions about the program context in which file is to be linked more aggressive compilation architectures perform cross file interprocedural or whole program analyses potentially producing much faster programs but substantially increasing the cost of compilation even more radical are systems that perform all compilation and optimization at run time such systems can optimize programs based on run time program and system properties as well as static whole program properties however run time compilers also called dynamic compilers or just in time compilers suffer under severe constraints on allowable compilation time since any time spent compiling steals from time spent running the program none of these compilation models dominates the others each has unique strengths and weaknesses not present in the other modelswe are developing new staged compilation model which strives to combine high run time code quality with low compilation overhead compilation is organized as series of stages with stages corresponding to for example separate compilation library linking program linking and run time execution any given optimization can be performed at any of these stages to reduce compilation time while maintaining high effectiveness an optimization should be performed at the earliest stage that provides the necessary program context information to carry out the optimization effectively moreover single optimization can itself be spread across multiple stages with earlier stages performing preplanning work that enables the final stage to complete the optimization quickly in this way we hope to produce highly optimized programs nearly as good as what could be done with purely run time compiler that had an unconstrained compilation time budget but at much more practical compile time costwe are building the whirlwind optimizing compiler as the concrete embodiment of this staged compilation model initially targeting object oriented languages key component of whirlwind is set of techniques for automatically constructing staged compilers from traditional unstaged compilers including aggressive applications of specialization and other partial evaluation technology

several mesh like coarse grained reconfigurable architectures have been devised in the last few years accompanied with their corresponding mapping flows one of the major bottlenecks in mapping algorithms on these architectures is the limited memory access bandwidth only few mapping methodologies encountered the problem of the limited bandwidth while none has explored how the performance improvements are affected from the architectural characteristics we study in this paper the impact that the architectural parameters have on performance speedups achieved when the pes local rams are used for storing the variables with data reuse opportunities the data reuse values are transferred in the internal interconnection network instead of being fetched from external memories in order to reduce the data transfer burden on the bus network novel mapping algorithm is also proposed that uses list scheduling technique the experimental results quantified the trade offs that exist between the performance improvements and the memory access latency the interconnection network and the processing element's local ram size for this reason our mapping methodology targets on flexible architecture template which permits such an exploration more specifically the experiments showed that the improvements increase with the memory access latency while richer interconnection topology can improve the operation parallelism by factor of on average finally for the considered set of benchmarks the operation parallelism has been improved from to from the application of our methodology and by having each pe's local ram size of words

sensor networks are very specific type of wireless networks where both security and performance issues need to be solved efficiently in order to avoid manipulations of the sensed data and at the same time minimize the battery energy consumption this paper proposes an efficient way to perform data collection by grouping the sensors in aggregation zones allowing the aggregators to process the sensed data inside the aggregation zone in order to minimize the amount of transmissions to the sink moreover the paper provides security mechanism based on hash chains to secure data transmissions in networks with low capability sensors and without the requirements of an instantaneous source authentication
grid resources are non dedicated and thus grid users are forced to compete with resource owners for idle cpu cycles as result the turnaround times of both the grid jobs and the owners jobs are invariably delayed to resolve this problem the current study proposes progressive multi layer resource reconfiguration framework designated as pmr in which intra and inter site reconfiguration strategies are employed to adapt grid users jobs dynamically to changes in the available cpu resources at each node the experimental results show that pmr enables the idle cpu cycles of resource to be fully exploited by grid users with minimum interference to the resource owner's jobs
there exist emerging applications of data streams that require association rule mining such as network traffic monitoring and web click streams analysis different from data in traditional static databases data streams typically arrive continuously in high speed with huge amount and changing data distribution this raises new issues that need to be considered when developing association rule mining techniques for stream data this paper discusses those issues and how they are addressed in the existing literature
classification is an important problem in data mining given an example and class classifier usually works by estimating the probability of being member of ie membership probability well calibrated classifiers are those able to provide accurate estimates of class membership probabilities that is the estimated probability is close to which is the true empirical probability of being member of given that the probability estimated by the classifier is calibration is not necessary property for producing accurate classifiers and thus most of the research has focused on direct accuracy maximization strategies ie maximum margin rather than on calibration however non calibrated classifiers are problematic in applications where the reliability associated with prediction must be taken into account ie cost sensitive classification cautious classification etc in these applications sensible use of the classifier must be based on the reliability of its predictions and thus the classifier must be well calibrated in this paper we show that lazy associative classifiers lac are accurate and well calibrated using well known sound entropy minimization method we explore important applications where such characteristics ie accuracy and calibration are relevant and we demonstrate empirically that lac drastically outperforms other classifiers such as svms naive bayes and decision trees even after these classifiers are calibrated by specific methods additional highlights of lac include the ability to incorporate reliable predictions for improving training and the ability to refrain from doubtful predictions

we analyze theoretically the subspace best approximating images of convex lambertian object taken from the same viewpoint but under different distant illumination conditions since the lighting is an arbitrary function the space of all possible images is formally infinite dimensional however previous empirical work has shown that images of largely diffuse objects actually lie very close to five dimensional subspace in this paper we analytically construct the principal component analysis for images of convex lambertian object explicitly taking attached shadows into account and find the principal eigenmodes and eigenvalues with respect to lighting variability our analysis makes use of an analytic formula for the irradiance in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients of the illumination and shows under appropriate assumptions that the principal components or eigenvectors are identical to the spherical harmonic basis functions evaluated at the surface normal vectors our main contribution is in extending these results to the single viewpoint case showing how the principal eigenmodes and eigenvalues are affected when only limited subset the upper hemisphere of normals is available and the spherical harmonics are no longer orthonormal over the restricted domain our results are very close both qualitatively and quantitatively to previous empirical observations and represent the first essentially complete theoretical explanation of these observations our analysis is also likely to be of interest in other areas of computer vision and image based rendering in particular our results indicate that using complex illumination for photometric problems in computer vision is not significantly more difficult than using directional sources
various programming languages allow the construction of structure shy programs such programs are defined generically for many different datatypes and only specify specific behavior for few relevant subtypes typical examples are xml query languages that allow selection of subdocuments without exhaustively specifying intermediate element tags other examples are languages and libraries for polytypic or strategic functional programming and for adaptive object oriented programming in this paper we present an algebraic approach to transformation of declarative structure shy programs in particular for strategic functions and xml queries we formulate rich set of algebraic laws not just for transformation of structure shy programs but also for their conversion into structure sensitive programs and vice versa we show how subsets of these laws can be used to construct effective rewrite systems for specialization generalization and optimization of structure shy programs we present type safe encoding of these rewrite systems in haskell which itself uses strategic functional programming techniques
programs which manipulate pointers are hard to debug pointer analysis algorithms originally aimed at optimizing compilers may provide some remedy by identifying potential errors such as dereferencing null pointers by statically analyzing the behavior of programs on all their input dataour goal is to identify the core program analysis techniques that can be used when developing realistic tools which detect memory errors at compile time without generating too many false alarms our preliminary experience indicates that the following techniques are necessary finding aliases between pointers ii flow sensitive techniques that account for the program control flow constructs iii partial interpretation of conditional statements iv analysis of the relationships between pointers and sometimes analysis of the underlying data structures manipulated by the programwe show that combination of these techniques can yield better results than those achieved by state of the art tools yet it is not clear to us whether our ideas are applicable to large programs
in this paper we introduce new approach for the embedding of linear elastic deformable models our technique results in significant improvements in the efficient physically based simulation of highly detailed objects first our embedding takes into account topological details that is disconnected parts that fall into the same coarse element are simulated independently second we account for the varying material properties by computing stiffness and interpolation functions for coarse elements which accurately approximate the behaviour of the embedded material finally we also take into account empty space in the coarse embeddings which provides better simulation of the boundary the result is straightforward approach to simulating complex deformable models with the ease and speed associated with coarse regular embedding and with quality of detail that would only be possible at much finer resolution

through analysis and experiments this paper investigates two phase waiting algorithms to minimize the cost of waiting for synchronization in large scale multiprocessors in two phase algorithm thread first waits by polling synchronization variable if the cost of polling reaches limit lpoll and further waiting is necessary the thread is blocked incurring an additional fixed cost the choice of lpoll is critical determinant of the performance of two phase algorithms we focus on methods for statically determining lpoll because the run time overhead of dynamically determining lpoll can be comparable to the cost of blocking in large scale multiprocessor systems with lightweight threads our experiments show that always block lpoll is good waiting algorithm with performance that is usually close to the best of the algorithms compared we show that even better performance can be achieved with static choice of lpoll based on knowledge of likely wait time distributions motivated by the observation that different synchronization types exhibit different wait time distributions we prove that static choice of lpoll can yield close to optimal on line performance against an adversary that is restricted to choosing wait times from fixed family of probability distributions this result allows us to make an optimal static choice of lpoll based on synchronization type for exponentially distributed wait times we prove that setting lpoll results in waiting cost that is no more than times the cost of an optimal off line algorithm for uniformly distributed wait times we prove that setting lpoll square root of results in waiting cost that is no more than square root of the golden ratio times the cost of an optimal off line algorithm experimental measurements of several parallel applications on the alewife multiprocessor simulator corroborate our theoretical findings

the restricted correspondence problem is the task of solving the classical stereo correspondence problem when the surface being observed is known to belong to family of surfaces that vary in known way with one or more parameters under this constraint the surface can be extracted far more robustly than by classical stereo applied to an arbitrary surface since the problem is solved semi globally rather than locally for each epipolar line here the restricted correspondence problem is solved for two examples the first being the extraction of the parameters of an ellipsoid from calibrated stereo pair the second example is the estimation of the osculating paraboloid at the frontier points of convex object
recently research on text mining has attracted lots of attention from both industrial and academic fields text mining concerns of discovering unknown patterns or knowledge from large text repository the problem is not easy to tackle due to the semi structured or even unstructured nature of those texts under consideration many approaches have been devised for mining various kinds of knowledge from texts one important aspect of text mining is on automatic text categorization which assigns text document to some predefined category if the document falls into the theme of the category traditionally the categories are arranged in hierarchical manner to achieve effective searching and indexing as well as easy comprehension for human beings the determination of category themes and their hierarchical structures were most done by human experts in this work we developed an approach to automatically generate category themes and reveal the hierarchical structure among them we also used the generated structure to categorize text documents the document collection was trained by self organizing map to form two feature maps these maps were then analyzed to obtain the category themes and their structure although the test corpus contains documents written in chinese the proposed approach can be applied to documents written in any language and such documents can be transformed into list of separated terms

dynamic binary translators dbts provide powerful platforms for building dynamic program monitoring and adaptation tools dbts however have high memory demands because they cache translated code and auxiliary code to software code cache and must also maintain data structures to support the code cache the high memory demands make it difficult for memory constrained embedded systems to take advantage of dbt based tools previous research on dbt memory management focused on the translated code and auxiliary code only however we found that data structures are comparable to the code cache in size we show that the translated code size auxiliary code size and the data structure size interact in complex manner depending on the path selection trace selection and link formation strategy therefore holistic memory efficiency comprising translated code auxiliary code and data structures cannot be improved by focusing on the code cache only in this paper we use path selection for improving holistic memory efficiency which in turn impacts performance in memory constrained environments although there has been previous research on path selection such research only considered performance in memory unconstrained environments the challenge for holistic memory efficiency is that the path selection strategy results in complex interactions between the memory demand components also individual aspects of path selection and the holistic memory efficiency may impact performance in complex ways we explore these interactions to motivate path selection targeting holistic memory demand we enumerate all the aspects involved in path selection design and evaluate comprehensive set of approaches for each aspect finally we propose path selection strategy that reduces memory demands by and at the same time improves performance by compared to an industrial strength dbt
effective identification of coexpressed genes and coherent patterns in gene expression data is an important task in bioinformatics research and biomedical applications several clustering methods have recently been proposed to identify coexpressed genes that share similar coherent patterns however there is no objective standard for groups of coexpressed genes the interpretation of co expression heavily depends on domain knowledge furthermore groups of coexpressed genes in gene expression data are often highly connected through large number of intermediate genes there may be no clear boundaries to separate clusters clustering gene expression data also faces the challenges of satisfying biological domain requirements and addressing the high connectivity of the data sets in this paper we propose an interactive framework for exploring coherent patterns in gene expression data novel coherent pattern index is proposed to give users highly confident indications of the existence of coherent patterns to derive coherent pattern index and facilitate clustering we devise an attraction tree structure that summarizes the coherence information among genes in the data set we present efficient and scalable algorithms for constructing attraction trees and coherent pattern indices from gene expression data sets our experimental results show that our approach is effective in mining gene expression data and is scalable for mining large data sets
we address specific enterprise document search scenario where the information need is expressed in an elaborate manner in our scenario information needs are expressed using short query of few keywords together with examples of key reference pages given this setup we investigate how the examples can be utilized to improve the end to end performance on the document retrieval task our approach is based on language modeling framework where the query model is modified to resemble the example pages we compare several methods for sampling expansion terms from the example pages to support query dependent and query independent query expansion the latter is motivated by the wish to increase aspect recall and attempts to uncover aspects of the information need not captured by the query for evaluation purposes we use the csiro data set created for the trec enterprise track the best performance is achieved by query models based on query independent sampling of expansion terms from the example documents
the view update problem is concerned with indirectly modifying those tuples that satisfy view or derived table by an appropriate update against the corresponding base tables the notion of deduction tree is defined and the relationship between such trees and the view update problem for indefinite deductive databases is considered it is shown that traversal of an appropriate deduction tree yields sufficient information to perform view updates at the propositional level to obtain similar result at the first order level it is necessary for theoretical and computational reasons to impose some weak stratification and definiteness constraints on the database
this paper describes new method for contouring signed grid whose edges are tagged by hermite data ie exact intersection points and normals this method avoids the need to explicitly identify and process features as required in previous hermite contouring methods using new numerically stable representation for quadratic error functions we develop an octree based method for simplifying contours produced by this method we next extend our contouring method to these simpli pound ed octrees this new method imposes no constraints on the octree such as being restricted octree and requires no crack patching we conclude with simple test for preserving the topology of the contour during simplification
benchmarking is critical when evaluating performance but is especially difficult for file and storage systems complex interactions between devices caches kernel daemons and other os components result in behavior that is rather difficult to analyze moreover systems have different features and optimizations so no single benchmark is always suitable the large variety of workloads that these systems experience in the real world also adds to this difficulty in this article we survey file system and storage benchmarks from recent papers we found that most popular benchmarks are flawed and many research papers do not provide clear indication of true performance we provide guidelines that we hope will improve future performance evaluations to show how some widely used benchmarks can conceal or overemphasize overheads we conducted set of experiments as specific example slowing down read operations on ext by factor of resulted in only percnt wall clock slowdown in popular compile benchmark finally we discuss future work to improve file system and storage benchmarking
vector and matrix clocks are extensively used in asynchronous distributed systems this paper asks how does the clock abstraction generalize to address this problem the paper motivates and proposes logical clocks of arbitrary dimensions it then identifies and explores the conceptual link between such clocks and knowledge it establishes the necessary and sufficient conditions on the size and dimension of clocks required to attain any specified level of knowledge about the timestamp of the most recent system state for which this is possible without using any messages in the clock protocol the paper then gives algorithms to determine the time stamp of the latest system state about which specified level of knowledge is attainable in given system state and to compute the timestamp of the earliest system state in which specified level of knowledge about given system state is attainable the results are applicable to applications that deal with certain class of properties identified as monotonic properties
check if we can apply woodruff's method to our protocol we show an efficient secure two party protocol based on yao's construction which provides security against malicious adversaries yao's original protocol is only secure in the presence of semi honest adversaries security against malicious adversaries can be obtained by applying the compiler of goldreich micali and wigderson the gmw compiler however this approach does not seem to be very practical as it requires using generic zero knowledge proofsour construction is based on applying cut and choose techniques to the original circuit and inputs security is proved according to the ideal real simulation paradigm and the proof is in the standard model with no random oracle model or common reference string assumptions the resulting protocol is computationally efficient the only usage of asymmetric cryptography is for running oblivious transfers for each input bit or for each bit of statistical security parameter whichever is larger our protocol combines techniques from folklore like cut and choose along with new techniques for efficiently proving consistency of inputs we remark that naive implementation of the cut and choose technique with yao's protocol does not yield secure protocol this is the first paper to show how to properly implement these techniques and to provide full proof of securityour protocol can also be interpreted as constant round black box reduction of secure two party computation to oblivious transfer and perfectly hiding commitments or black box reduction of secure two party computation to oblivious transfer alone with number of rounds which is linear in statistical security parameter these two reductions are comparable to kilian's reduction which uses ot alone but incurs number of rounds which is linear in the depth of the circuit
reuse signature or reuse distance pattern is an accurate model for program memory accessing behaviors it has been studied and shown to be effective in program analysis and optimizations by many recent works however the high overhead associated with reuse distance measurement restricts the scope of its application this paper explores applying sampling in reuse signature collection to reduce the time overhead we compare different sampling strategies and show that an enhanced systematic sampling with uniform coverage of all distance ranges can be used to extrapolate the reuse distance distribution based on that analysis we present novel sampling method with measurement accuracy of more than our average speedup of reuse signature collection is while the best improvement observed is this is the first attempt to utilize sampling in measuring reuse signatures experiments with varied programs and instrumentation tools show that sampling has great potential in promoting the practical uses of reuse signatures and enabling more optimization opportunities
embedded system designers face unique set of challenges in making their systems more secure as these systems often have stringent resource constraints or must operate in harsh or physically insecure environments one of the security issues that have recently drawn attention is software integrity which ensures that the programs in the system have not been changed either by an accident or an attack in this paper we propose an efficient hardware mechanism for runtime verification of software integrity using encrypted instruction block signatures we introduce several variations of the basic mechanism and give details of three techniques that are most suitable for embedded systems performance evaluation using selected mibench mediabench and basicrypt benchmarks indicates that the considered techniques impose relatively small performance overhead the best overall technique has performance overhead in the range when protecting byte instruction blocks with byte signatures with byte instruction blocks the overhead is in the range the average overhead with kb cache is with additional investment in signature cache this overhead can be almost completely eliminated
clustered microarchitectures are an effective organization to deal with the problem of wire delays and complexity by partitioning some of the processor resources the organization of the data cache is key factor in these processors due to its effect on cache miss rate and inter cluster communications this paper investigates alternative designs of the data cache centralized distributed replicated and physically distributed cache architectures are analyzed results show similar average performance but significant performance variations depending on the application features specially cache miss ratio and communications in addition we also propose novel instruction steering scheme in order to reduce communications this scheme conditionally stalls the dispatch of instructions depending on the occupancy of the clusters whenever the current instruction cannot be steered to the cluster holding most of the inputs this new steering outperforms traditional schemes results show an average speedup of and up to for some applications
age specific human computer interaction ashci has vast potential applications in daily life however automatic age estimation technique is still underdeveloped one of the main reasons is that the aging effects on human faces present several unique characteristics which make age estimation challenging task that requires non standard classification approaches according to the speciality of the facial aging effects this paper proposes the ages aging pattern subspace method for automatic age estimation the basic idea is to model the aging pattern which is defined as sequence of personal aging face images by learning representative subspace the proper aging pattern for an unseen face image is then determined by the projection in the subspace that can best reconstruct the face image while the position of the face image in that aging pattern will indicate its age the ages method has shown encouraging performance in the comparative experiments either as an age estimator or as an age range estimator

in this paper we extend the scope of mining association rules from traditional single dimensional intratransaction associations to multidimensional intertransaction associations intratransaction associations are the associations among items with the same transaction where the notion of the transaction could be the items bought by the same customer the events happened on the same day and so on however an intertransaction association describes the association relationships among different transactions such as ldquo if company a's stock goes up on day b's stock will go down on day but go up on day rdquo in this case whether we treat company or day as the unit of transaction the associated items belong to different transactions moreover such an intertransaction association can be extended to associate multiple contextual properties in the same rule so that multidimensional intertransaction associations can be defined and discovered two dimensional intertransaction association rule example is ldquo after mcdonald and burger king open branches kfc will open branch two months later and one mile away rdquo which involves two dimensions time and space mining intertransaction associations poses more challenges on efficient processing than mining intratransaction associations interestingly intratransaction association can be treated as special case of intertransaction association from both conceptual and algorithmic point of view in this study we introduce the notion of multidimensional intertransaction association rules study their measurements mdash support and confidence mdash and develop algorithms for mining intertransaction associations by extension of apriori we overview our experience using the algorithms on both real life and synthetic data sets further extensions of multidimensional intertransaction association rules and potential applications are also discussed

we propose simple obstacle model to be used while simulating wireless sensor networks to the best of our knowledge this is the first time such an integrated and systematic obstacle model for these networks has been proposed we define several types of obstacles that can be found inside the deployment area of wireless sensor network and provide categorization of these obstacles based on their nature physical and communication obstacles ie obstacles that are formed out of node distribution patterns or have physical presence respectively their shape and their change of nature over time we make an extension to custom made sensor network simulator simdust and conduct number of simulations in order to study the effect of obstacles on the performance of some representative in terms of their logic data propagation protocols for wireless sensor networks our findings confirm that obstacle presence has significant impact on protocol performance and also that different obstacle shapes and sizes may affect each protocol in different ways this provides an insight into how routing protocol will perform in the presence of obstacles and highlights possible protocol shortcomings moreover our results show that the effect of obstacles is not directly related to the density of sensor network and cannot be emulated only by changing the network density
technological achievements have made it possible to fabricate cmos circuits with over billion transistors implement boolean operations using quantum devices and or the spin of an electron implement transformations using bio and molecular based cells problems with many of these technologies are due to such factors as process variations defects and impurities in materials and solutions and noise consequently many systems built from these technologies operate imperfectly luckily there are many complex and large market systems applications that tolerate acceptable though not always correct results in addition there is emerging body of mathematical analysis related to imperfect computation in this paper we first introduce the concepts of acceptable error tolerance and acceptable performance degradation and demonstrate how important attributes of these concepts can be quantified we interlace this discussion with several examples of systems that can effectively employ these two concepts next we mention several immerging technologies that motivate the need to study these concepts as well as related mathematical paradigms finally we will list few cad issues that are needed to support this new form of technological revolution
in mainstream oo languages inheritance can be used to add new methods or to override existing methods virtual classes and feature oriented programming are techniques which extend the mechanism of inheritance so that it is possible to refine nested classes as well these techniques are attractive for programming in the large because inheritance becomes tool for manipulating whole class hierarchies rather than individual classes nevertheless it has proved difficult to design static type systems for virtual classes because virtual classes introduce dependent types the compile time type of an expression may depend on the run time values of objects in that expressionwe present formal object calculus which implements virtual classes in type safe manner our type system uses novel technique based on prototypes which blur the distinction between compile time and run time at run time prototypes act as objects and they can be used in ordinary computations at compile time they act as types prototypes are similar in power to dependent types and subtyping is shown to be form of partial evaluation we prove that prototypes are type safe but undecidable and briefly outline decidable semi algorithm for dealing with them
distributed sparing is method to improve the performance of raid disk arrays with respect to dedicated sparing system with disks including the spare disk since it utilizes the bandwidth of all disks we analyze the performance of raid with distributed sparing in normal mode degraded mode and rebuild mode in an oltp environment which implies small reads and writes the analysis in normal mode uses an queuing model which takes into account the components of disk service time in degraded mode low cost approximate method is developed to estimate the mean response time of fork join requests resulting from accesses to recreate lost data on the failed disk rebuild mode performance is analyzed by considering an vacationing server model with multiple vacations of different types to take into account differences in processing requirements for reading the first and subsequent tracks an iterative solution method is used to estimate the mean response time of disk requests as well as the time to read each disk which is shown to be quite accurate through validation against simulation results we next compare raid performance in system without cache with cache and with nonvolatile storage nvs cache the last configuration in addition to improved read response time due to cache hits provides fast write capability such that dirty blocks can be destaged asynchronously and at lower priority than read requests resulting in an improvement in read response time the small write penalty is also reduced due to the possibility of repeated writes to dirty blocks in the cache and by taking advantage of disk geometry to efficiently destage multiple blocks at time
this work investigates the problem of privacy preserving mining of frequent itemsets we propose procedure to protect the privacy of data by adding noisy items to each transaction then an algorithm is proposed to reconstruct frequent itemsets from these noise added transactions the experimental results indicate that this method can achieve rather high level of accuracy our method utilizes existing algorithms for frequent itemset mining and thereby takes full advantage of their progress to mine frequent itemset efficiently
in mobile computing environments as result of the reduced capacity of local storage it is commonly not feasible to replicate entire datasets on each mobile unit in addition reliable secure and economical access to central servers is not always possible moreover since mobile computers are designed to be portable they are also physically small and thus often unable to hold or process the large amounts of data held in centralised databases as many systems are only as useful as the data they can process the support provided by database and system management middleware for applications in mobile environments is an important driver for the uptake of this technology by application providers and thus also for the wider use of the technologyone of the approaches to maximize the available storage is through the use of database summarisation to date most strategies for reducing data volumes have used compression techniques that ignore the semantics of the data those that do not use data compression techniques adopt structural ie data and use independent methods in this paper we outline the special constraints imposed on storing information in mobile databases and provide flexible data summarisation policy the method works by assigning level of priority to each data item through the setting of number of parameters the paper discusses some policies for setting these parameters and some implementation strategies
with concurrent and garbage collected languages like java and becoming popular the need for suitable non intrusive efficient and concurrent multiprocessor garbage collector has become acute we propose novel mark and sweep on the fly algorithm based on the sliding views mechanism of levanoni and petrank we have implemented our collector on the jikes java virtual machine running on netfinity multiprocessor and compared it to the concurrent algorithm and to the stop the world collector supplied with jikes jvm the maximum pause time that we measured with our benchmarks over all runs was ms in all runs the pause times were smaller than those of the stop the world collector by two orders of magnitude and they were also always shorter than the pauses of the jikes concurrent collector throughput measurements of the new garbage collector show that it outperforms the jikes concurrent collector by up to as expected the stop the world does better than the on the fly collectors with results showing about differenceon top of being an effective mark and sweep on the fly collector standing on its own our collector may also be used as backup collector collecting cyclic data structures for the levanoni petrank reference counting collector these two algorithms perfectly fit sharing the same allocator similar data structure and similar jvm interface

broadcast data dissemination is well suited for mobile wireless environments where bandwidth is scarce and mutual interference must be minimised however broadcasting monopolises the medium precluding clients from performing any other communication we address this problem in two ways firstly we segment the server broadcast with intervening periods of silence during which the wireless devices may communicate secondly we reduce the average access delay for clients using novel cooperative caching scheme our scheme is fully decentralised and uses information available locally at the client our results show that our model prevents the server from monopolising the medium and that our caching strategy reduces client access delays significantly
recently planning based on answer set programming has been proposed as an approach towards realizing declarative planning systems in this paper we present the language κc which extends the declarative planning language by action costs κc provides the notion of admissible and optimal plans which are plans whose overall action costs are within given limit resp minimum over all plans ie cheapest plans as we demonstrate this novel language allows for expressing some nontrivial planning tasks in declarative way furthermore it can be utilized for representing planning problems under other optimality criteria such as computing shortest plans with the least number of steps and refinement combinations of cheapest and fastest plans we study complexity aspects of the language κc and provide transformation to logic programs such that planning problems are solved via answer set programming furthermore we report experimental results on selected problems our experience is encouraging that answer set planning may be valuable approach to expressive planning systems in which intricate planning problems can be naturally specified and solved

mobile services operate on hosts with diverse capabilities in heterogeneous networks where the usage of resources such as processor memory and network is constantly changing in order to maintain efficiency in terms of performance and resource utilization such services should be able to adapt to changes in their environmentthis paper proposes and empirically evaluates an application transparent adaptation strategy for service oriented systems the strategy is based upon the solution of an optimization model derived from an existing suite of metrics for services which maps system services to network nodesthe strategy is evaluated empirically using number of distinct scenarios involving runtime changes in processor memory and network utilization in order to maintain execution efficiency in response to these changing operating conditions the strategy rearranges the service topology of the system dynamically by moving services between network nodes the results show that the negative impact of environmental changes on runtime efficiency can be reduced after adaptation from to depending on the selected parameters

upcoming multi media compression applications will require high memory bandwidth in this paper we estimate that software reference implementation of an mpeg video decoder typically requires mtransfers to memory to decode cif times video object plane vop at frames this imposes high penalty in terms of power but also performancehowever we also show that we can heavily improve on the memory transfers without sacrificing speed even gaining about on cache misses and cycles for dec alpha by aggressive code transformations for this purpose we have manually applied an extended version of our data transfer and storage exploration dtse methodology which was originally developed for custom hardware implementations
although hierarchical pp systems have been found to outperform flat systems in many respects current pp research does not focus on strategies to build and maintain such systems available solutions assume either no or little coordination between peers that could lead the system toward satisfying globally defined goal eg minimizing traffic in this paper we focus on hierarchical dhts and provide full set of algorithms to build and maintain such systems that mitigate this problem in particular given the goal state of minimizing the total traffic without overloading any peer our algorithms dynamically adjust the system state as to keep the goal met at any time the algorithms are fully decentralized and probabilistic all decisions taken by the peers are based on their partial view on set of system wide parameters thus they demonstrate the main principle of self organization the system behavior emerges from local interactions our simulations run in range of realistic settings confirm good performance of the algorithms

this paper proposes neural network based approach for solving the resource discovery problem in peer to peer pp networks and an adaptive global local memetic algorithm aglma for performing the training of the neural network this training is very challenging due to the large number of weights and noise caused by the dynamic neural network testing the aglma is memetic algorithm consisting of an evolutionary framework which adaptively employs two local searchers having different exploration logic and pivot rules furthermore the aglma makes an adaptive noise compensation by means of explicit averaging on the fitness values and dynamic population sizing which aims to follow the necessity of the optimization process the numerical results demonstrate that the proposed computational intelligence approach leads to an efficient resource discovery strategy and that the aglma outperforms two classical resource discovery strategies as well as popular neural network training algorithm

process algebraic techniques for distributed systems are increasingly being targeted at identifying abstractions that are adequate for both high level programming and specification and security analysis and verification drawing on our earlier work in bugliesi and focardi we investigate the expressive power of core set of security and network abstractions that provide high level primitives for specifying the honest principals in network while at the same time enabling an analysis of the network level adversarial attacks that may be mounted by an intruder we analyse various bisimulation equivalences for security that arise from endowing the intruder with label label different adversarial capabilities and label ii label increasingly powerful control over the interaction among the distributed principals of network by comparing the relative strength of the bisimulation equivalences we obtain direct measure of the intruder's discriminating power and hence of the expressiveness of the corresponding intruder model
we present aspect oriented programming in jiazzi jiazzi enhances java with separately compiled externally linked code modules called units units can act as effective aspect constructs with the ability to separate crosscutting concern code in non invasive and safe way unit linking provides convenient way for programmers to explicitly control the inclusion and configuration of code that implements concern while separate compilation of units enhances the independent development and deployment of the concern the expressiveness of concern separation is enhanced by units in two ways first classes can be made open to the addition of new behavior fields and methods after they are initially defined which enables the direct modularization of concerns whose code crosscut object boundaries second the signatures of methods and classes can also be made open to refinement which permits more aggressive modularization by isolating the naming and calling requirements of concern implementation
end user programming has become ubiquitous so much so that there are more end user programmers today than there are professional programmers end user programming empowers but to do what make really bad decisions based on really bad programs enter software engineering's focus on quality considering software quality is necessary because there is ample evidence that the programs end users create are filled with expensive errors in this paper consider what happens when we add to end user programming environments considerations of software quality going beyond the create program aspect of end user programming describe philosophy to software engineering for end users and then survey several projects in this area basic premise is that end user software engineering can only succeed to the extent that it respects the fact that the user probably has little expertise or even interest in software engineering
motivated by the optimality of shortest remaining processing time srpt for mean response time in recent years many computer systems have used the heuristic of favoring small jobs in order to dramatically reduce user response times however rarely do computer systems have knowledge of exact remaining sizes in this paper we introduce the class of smart policies which formalizes the heuristic of favoring small jobs in way that includes wide range of policies that schedule using inexact job size information examples of smart policies include policies that use exact size information eg srpt and psjf ii policies that use job size estimates and iii policies that use finite number of size based priority levels for many smart policies eg srpt with inexact job size information there are no analytic results available in the literature in this work we prove four main results we derive upper and lower bounds on the mean response time the mean slowdown the response time tail and the conditional response time of smart policies in each case the results explicitly characterize the tradeoff between the accuracy of the job size information used to prioritize and the performance of the resulting policy thus the results provide designers insight into how accurate job size information must be in order to achieve desired performance guarantees
in this paper we show how to augment object oriented application interfaces with enhanced specifications that include sequencing constraints called protocols protocols make explicit the relationship between messages methods supported by the application these relationships are usually only given implicitly either in the code or in textual comments we define notions of interface compatibility based upon protocols and show how compatibility can be checked discovering class of errors that cannot be discovered via the type system alone we then define software adaptors that can be used to bridge the difference between object oriented applications that have functionally compatible but type incompatible interfaces we discuss what it means for an adaptor to be well formed leveraging the information provided by protocols we show how adaptors can be automatically generated from high level description called an interface mapping
location based and personalized services are the key factors for promoting user satisfaction however most service providers did not consider the needs of mobile user in terms of their location and event participation consequently the service provider may lose the chance for better service and profit in this paper we present multi stage collaborative filtering mscf process to provide event recommendation based on mobile user's location to achieve this purpose the collaborative filtering cf technique is employed and the adaptive resonance theory art network is applied to cluster mobile users according to their personal profile sequential pattern mining is then used to discover the correlations between events for recommendation the mscf is designed not only to recommend for the old registered mobile user ormu but also to handle the cold start problem for new registered mobile user nrmu this research is designed to achieve the followings to present personalized event recommendation system for mobile users to discover mobile users moving patterns to provide recommendations based on mobile users preferences to overcome the cold start problem for new registered mobile user the experimental results of this research show that the mscf is able to accomplish the above purposes and shows better outcome for cold start problem when comparing with user based cf and item based cf

various code certification systems allow the certification and static verification of important safety properties such as memory and control flow safety these systems are valuable tools for verifying that untrusted and potentially malicious code is safe before execution however one important safety property that is not usually included is that programs adhere to specific bounds on resource consumption such as running time we present decidable type system capable of specifying and certifying bounds on resource consumption our system makes two advances over previous resource bound certification systems both of which are necessary for practical system we allow the execution time of programs and their subroutines to vary depending on their arguments and we provide fully automatic compiler generating certified executables from source level programs the principal device in our approach is strategy for simulating dependent types using sum and inductive kinds

data domain description techniques aim at deriving concise descriptions of objects belonging to category of interest for instance the support vector domain description svdd learns hypersphere enclosing the bulk of provided unlabeled data such that points lying outside of the ball are considered anomalous however relevant information such as expert and background knowledge remain unused in the unsupervised setting in this paper we rephrase data domain description as semi supervised learning task that is we propose semi supervised generalization of data domain description sssvdd to process unlabeled and labeled examples the corresponding optimization problem is non convex we translate it into an unconstraint continuous problem that can be optimized accurately by gradient based techniques furthermore we devise an effective active learning strategy to query low confidence observations our empirical evaluation on network intrusion detection and object recognition tasks shows that our sssvdds consistently outperform baseline methods in relevant learning settings
hair simulation remains one of the most challenging aspects of creating virtual characters most research focuses on handling the massive geometric complexity of hundreds of thousands of interacting hairs this is accomplished either by using brute force simulation or by reducing degrees of freedom with guide hairs this paper presents hybrid eulerian lagrangian approach to handling both self and body collisions with hair efficiently while still maintaining detail bulk interactions and hair volume preservation is handled efficiently and effectively with flip based fluid solver while intricate hair hair interaction is handled with lagrangian self collisions thus the method has the efficiency of continuum guide based hair models with the high detail of lagrangian self collision approaches
we present an adaptive work stealing thread scheduler steal for fork join multithreaded jobs like those written using the cilk multithreaded language or the hood work stealing library the steal algorithm is appropriate for large parallel servers where many jobs share common multiprocessor resource and in which the number of processors available to particular job may vary during the job's execution steal provides continual parallelism feedback to job scheduler in the form of processor requests and the job must adaptits execution to the processors allotted to it assuming that the job scheduler never allots any job more processors than requested by thejob's thread scheduler steal guarantees that the job completes in near optimal time while utilizing at least constant fraction of the allotted processors our analysis models the job scheduler as the thread scheduler's adversary challenging the thread scheduler to be robust to the system environment and the job scheduler's administrative policies we analyze the performance of steal using trim analysis which allows us to prove that our thread scheduler performs poorly on at most small number of time steps while exhibiting near optimal behavior on the vast majority to be precise suppose that job has work and span critical path length on machine with processors steal completes the job in expected lg time steps where is the length of scheduling quantum and denotes the lg trimmed availability this quantity is the average of the processor availability over all but the lg time steps having the highest processor availability when the job's parallelism dominates the trimmed availability that is the job achieves nearly perfect linear speedup conversely when the trimmed mean dominates the parallelism the asymptotic running time of the job is nearly its span
mobile storage devices such as usb flash drives offer flexible solution for the transport and exchange of data nevertheless in order to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data many enterprises require strict security policies for the use of such devices with the effect of rendering their advantages rather unfruitful trusted virtual domains tvds provide secure it infrastructure offering homogeneous and transparent enforcement of access control policies on data and network resources however the current model does not specifically deal with mobile storage devices in this paper we present an extension of the tvd architecture to incorporate the usage of mobile storage devices our proposal addresses three major issues coherent extension of tvd policy enforcement by introducing architectural components that feature identification and management of transitory devices transparent mandatory encryption of sensitive data stored on mobile devices and highly dynamic centralized key management service in particular we address offline scenarios allowing users to access and modify data while being temporarily disconnected from the domain we also present prototype implementation based on the turaya security kernel
we consider the problem of clustering web image search results generally the image search results returned by an image search engine contain multiple topics organizing the results into different semantic clusters facilitates users browsing in this paper we propose hierarchical clustering method using visual textual and link analysis by using vision based page segmentation algorithm web page is partitioned into blocks and the textual and link information of an image can be accurately extracted from the block containing that image by using block level link analysis techniques an image graph can be constructed we then apply spectral techniques to find euclidean embedding of the images which respects the graph structure thus for each image we have three kinds of representations ie visual feature based representation textual feature based representation and graph based representation using spectral clustering techniques we can cluster the search results into different semantic clusters an image search example illustrates the potential of these techniques
several supervised learning algorithms are suited to classify instances into multiclass value space multinomial logit mnl is recognized as robust classifier and is commonly applied within the crm customer relationship management domain unfortunately to date it is unable to handle huge feature spaces typical of crm applications hence the analyst is forced to immerse himself into feature selection surprisingly in sharp contrast with binary logit current software packages lack any feature selection algorithm for multinomial logit conversely random forests another algorithm learning multiclass problems is just like mnl robust but unlike mnl it easily handles high dimensional feature spaces this paper investigates the potential of applying the random forests principles to the mnl framework we propose the random multinomial logit rmnl ie random forest of mnls and compare its predictive performance to that of mnl with expert feature selection random forests of classification trees we illustrate the random multinomial logit on cross sell crm problem within the home appliances industry the results indicate substantial increase in model accuracy of the rmnl model to that of the mnl model with expert feature selection

this article presents resolution matched shadow maps rmsm modified adaptive shadow map asm algorithm that is practical for interactive rendering of dynamic scenes adaptive shadow maps which build quadtree of shadow samples to match the projected resolution of each shadow texel in eye space offer robust solution to projective and perspective aliasing in shadow maps however their use for interactive dynamic scenes is plagued by an expensive iterative edge finding algorithm that takes highly variable amount of time per frame and is not guaranteed to converge to correct solution this article introduces simplified algorithm that is up to ten times faster than asms has more predictable performance and delivers more accurate shadows our main contribution is the observation that it is more efficient to forgo the iterative refinement analysis in favor of generating all shadow texels requested by the pixels in the eye space image the practicality of this approach is based on the insight that for surfaces continuously visible from the eye adjacent eye space pixels map to adjacent shadow texels in quadtree shadow space this means that the number of contiguous regions of shadow texels which can be efficiently generated with rasterizer is proportional to the number of continuously visible surfaces in the scene moreover these regions can be coalesced to further reduce the number of render passes required to shadow an image the secondary contribution of this paper is demonstrating the design and use of data parallel algorithms inseparably mixed with traditional graphics programming to implement novel interactive rendering algorithm for the scenes described in this paper we achieve frames per second on static scenes and frames per second on dynamic scenes for and images with maximum effective shadow resolution of texels
escape analysis is static analysis that determines whether the lifetime of data may exceed its static scopethis paper first presents the design and correctness proof of an escape analysis for javatm this analysis is interprocedural context sensitive and as flow sensitive as the static single assignment form so assignments to object fields are analyzed in flow insensitive manner since java is an imperative language the effect of assignments must be precisely determined this goal is achieved thanks to our technique using two interdependent analyses one forward one backward we introduce new method to prove the correctness of this analysis using aliases as an intermediate step we use integers to represent the escaping parts of values which leads to fast and precise analysisour implementation blanchet which applies to the whole java language is then presented escape analysis is applied to stack allocation and synchronization elimination in our benchmarks we stack allocate percnt to percnt of data eliminate more than percnt of synchronizations on most programs percnt and percnt on two examples and get up to percnt runtime decrease percnt on average our detailed experimental study on large programs shows that the improvement comes more from the decrease of the garbage collection and allocation times than from improvements on data locality contrary to what happened for ml this comes from the difference in the garbage collectors
regular path queries are way of declaratively expressing queries on graphs as regular expression like patterns that are matched against paths in the graph there are two kinds of queries existential queries which specify properties about individual paths and universal queries which specify properties about all paths they provide simple and convenient framework for expressing program analyses as queries on graph representations of programs for expressing verification model checking problems as queries on transition systems for querying semi structured data etc parametric regular path queries extend the patterns with variables called parameters which significantly increase the expressiveness by allowing additional information along single or multiple paths to be captured and relatethis paper shows how variety of program analysis and model checking problems can be expressed easily and succinctly using parametric regular path queries the paper describes the specification design analysis and implementation of algorithms and data structures for efficiently solving existential and universal parametric regular path queries major contributions include the first complete algorithms and data structures for directly and efficiently solving existential and universal parametric regular path queries detailed complexity analysis of the algorithms detailed analytical and experimental performance comparison of variations of the algorithms and data structures and investigation of efficiency tradeoffs between different formulations of queries
mobile agent technology has emerged as promising programming paradigm for developing highly dynamic and large scale service oriented computing middlewares due to its desirable features for this purpose first of all scalable location transparent agent communication issue should be addressed in mobile agent systems despite agent mobility although there were proposed several directory service and message delivery mechanisms their disadvantages force them not to be appropriate to both low overhead location management and fast delivery of messages to agents migrating frequently to mitigate their limitations this paper presents scalable distributed directory service and message delivery mechanism the proposed mechanism enables each mobile agent to autonomously leave tails of forwarding pointers on some few of its visiting nodes depending on its preferences this feature results in low message forwarding overhead and low storage and maintenance cost of increasing chains of pointers per host also keeping mobile agent location information in the effective binding cache of each sending agent the sending agent can communicate with mobile agents much faster compared with the existing ones
idle resources can be exploited not only to run important local tasks such as data replication and virus checking but also to make contributions to society by participating in open computing projects like seti home when executing background processes to utilize such valuable idle resources we need to explicitly control them so that the user will not be discouraged from exploiting idle resources by foreground performance degradation unfortunately common priority based schedulers lack such explicit execution control in addition to encourage active use of idle resources mechanism for controlling background processes should not require modifications to the underlying operating system or user applications if such modifications are required the user may be reluctant to employ the mechanism in this paper we argue that we can reasonably detect resource contention between foreground and background processes and properly control background process execution at the user level we infer the existence of resource contention from the approximated resource shares of background processes our approach takes advantage of dynamically instrumented probes which are becoming increasingly popular in estimating the resource shares also it considers different resource types in combination and can handle varied workloads including multiple background processes we show that our system effectively avoids the performance degradation of foreground activities by suspending background processes in an appropriate fashion our system keeps the increase in foreground execution time due to background processes below or much lower in most of our experiments also we extend our approach to address undesirable resource allocations to cpu intensive processes that can occur in multiprocessor environments
we practices lack an impact on industry partly due to we field that is not quality aware in fact it is difficult to find we methodologies that pay explicit attention to quality aspects however the use of systematic process that includes quality concerns from the earliest stages of development can contribute to easing the building up of quality guaranteed web applications without drastically increasing development costs and time to market in this kind of process quality issues should be taken into account while developing each outgoing artifact from the requirements model to the final application also quality models should be defined to evaluate the quality of intermediate we artifacts and how it contributes to improving the quality of the deployed application in order to tackle its construction while avoiding some of the most common problems that existing quality models suffer from in this paper we propose number of we quality models to address the idiosyncrasies of the different stakeholders and we software artifacts involved additionally we propose that these we quality models are supported by an ontology based we measurement meta model that provides set of concepts with clear semantics and relationships this we quality metamodel is one of the main contributions of this paper furthermore we provide an example that illustrates how such metamodel may drive the definition of particular we quality model
in this work we present rendering method with guaranteed interactive frame rates in complex scenes the algorithm is based on an new data structure determined in preprocessing to avoid frozen displays in large simulative visualizations like industrial plants typically described as cad models within preprocessing polygons are grouped by size and within these groups core clusters are calculated based on similarity and locality the clusters and polygons are building up hierarchy including weights ascertained within repetitive stages of re grouping and re clustering this additional information allows to choose subset over all primitives to reduce scene complexity depending on the viewer's position sight and the determined weights within the hierarchy to guarantee specific frame rate the number of rendered primitives is limited by constant and typically constrained by hardware this reduction is controlled by the pre calculated weights and the viewer's position and is not done arbitrarily at least the rendered section is suitable scene approximation that includes the viewer's interests combining all this constant frame rate including million polygons at fps is obtainable practical results indicate that our approach leads to good scene approximations and realtime rendering of very large environments at the same time
because of the high volume and unpredictable arrival rate stream processing systems may not always be able to keep up with the input data streams resulting in buffer overflow and uncontrolled loss of data load shedding the prevalent strategy for solving this overflow problem has so far only been considered for relational stream processing but not for xml shedding applied to xml stream processing brings new opportunities and challenges due to complex nested nature of xml structures in this paper we tackle this unsolved xml shedding problem using three pronged approach first we develop an xquery preference model that enables users to specify the relative importance of preserving different subpatterns in the xml result structure this transforms shedding into the problem of rewriting the user query into shed queries that return approximate query answers with utility as measured by the given user preference model second we develop cost model to compare the performance of alternate shed queries third we develop two shedding algorithms optshed and fastshed optshed guarantees to find an optimal solution however at the cost of exponential complexity fastshed as confirmed by our experiments achieves close to optimal result in wide range of test cases finally we describe the in automaton shedding mechanism for xquery stream engines the experiments show that our proposed utility driven shedding solutions consistently achieve higher utility results compared to the existing relational shedding techniques
in the recent years the web has been rapidly deepened with the prevalence of databases online on this deep web many sources are structured by providing structured query interfaces and results organizing such structured sources into domain hierarchy is one of the critical steps toward the integration of heterogeneous web sources we observe that for structured web sources query schemas ie attributes in query interfaces are discriminative representatives of the sources and thus can be exploited for source characterization in particular by viewing query schemas as type of categorical data we abstract the problem of source organization into the clustering of categorical data our approach hypothesizes that homogeneous sources are characterized by the same hidden generative models for their schemas to find clusters governed by such statistical distributions we propose new objective function model differentiation which employs principled hypothesis testing to maximize statistical heterogeneity among clusters our evaluation over hundreds of real sources indicates that the schema based clustering accurately organizes sources by object domains eg books movies and on clustering web query schemas the model differentiation function outperforms existing ones such as likelihood entropy and context linkages with the hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm
nearest neighbor search is an important and widely used technique in number of important application domains in many of these domains the dimensionality of the data representation is often very high recent theoretical results have shown that the concept of proximity or nearest neighbors may not be very meaningful for the high dimensional case therefore it is often complex problem to find good quality nearest neighbors in such data sets furthermore it is also difficult to judge the value and relevance of the returned results in fact it is hard for any fully automated system to satisfy user about the quality of the nearest neighbors found unless he is directly involved in the process this is especially the case for high dimensional data in which the meaningfulness of the nearest neighbors found is questionable in this paper we address the complex problem of high dimensional nearest neighbor search from the user perspective by designing system which uses effective cooperation between the human and the computer the system provides the user with visual representations of carefully chosen subspaces of the data in order to repeatedly elicit his preferences about the data patterns which are most closely related to the query point these preferences are used in order to determine and quantify the meaningfulness of the nearest neighbors our system is not only able to find and quantify the meaningfulness of the nearest neighbors but is also able to diagnose situations in which the nearest neighbors found are truly not meaningful
we propose finite element simulation method that addresses the full range of material behavior from purely elastic to highly plastic for physical domains that are substantially reshaped by plastic flow fracture or large elastic deformations to mitigate artificial plasticity we maintain simulation mesh in both the current state and the rest shape and store plastic offsets only to represent the non embeddable portion of the plastic deformation to maintain high element quality in tetrahedral mesh undergoing gross changes we use dynamic meshing algorithm that attempts to replace as few tetrahedra as possible and thereby limits the visual artifacts and artificial diffusion that would otherwise be introduced by repeatedly remeshing the domain from scratch our dynamic mesher also locally refines and coarsens mesh and even creates anisotropic tetrahedra wherever simulation requests it we illustrate these features with animations of elastic and plastic behavior extreme deformations and fracture
shopping lists play central role in grocery shopping among other things shopping lists serve as memory aids and as tool for budgeting more interestingly shopping lists serve as an expression and indication of customer needs and interests accordingly shopping lists can be used as an input for recommendation techniques in this paper we describe methodology for making recommendations about additional products to purchase using items on the user's shopping list as shopping list entries seldom correspond to products we first use information retrieval techniques to map the shopping list entries into candidate products association rules are used to generate recommendations based on the candidate products we evaluate the usefulness and interestingness of the recommendations in user study

the advance of multi core architectures provides significant benefits for parallel and throughput oriented computing but the performance of individual computation threads does not improve and may even suffer penalty because of the increased contention for shared resources this paper explores the idea of using available general purpose cores in cmp as helper engines for individual threads running on the active cores we propose lightweight architectural framework for efficient event driven software emulation of complex hardware accelerators and describe how this framework can be applied to implement variety of prefetching techniques we demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of our framework on wide range of applications from the spec cpu and olden benchmark suites on average our mechanism provides performance benefits within of pure hardware implementations furthermore we demonstrate that running event driven prefetching threads on top of baseline with hardware stride prefetcher yields significant speedups for many programs finally we show that our approach provides competitive performance improvements over other hardware approaches for multi core execution while executing fewer instructions and requiring considerably less hardware support
texture is an essential component of computer generated models for texture mapping procedure to be effective it has to generate continuous textures and cause only small mapping distortion the angle based flattening abf parameterization method is guaranteed to provide continuous no foldovers mapping it also minimizes the angular distortion of the parameterization including locating the optimal planar domain boundary however since it concentrates on minimizing the angular distortion of the mapping it can introduce relatively large linear distortionin this paper we introduce new procedure for reducing length distortion of an existing parameterization and apply it to abf results the linear distortion reduction is added as second step in texture mapping computation the new method is based on computing mapping from the plane to itself which has length distortion very similar to that of the abf parameterization by applying the inverse mapping to the result of the initial parameterization we obtain new parameterization with low length distortion we notice that the procedure for computing the inverse mapping can be applied to any other convenient mapping from the three dimensional surface to the plane in order to improve itthe mapping in the plane is computed by applying weighted laplacian smoothing to cartesian grid covering the planar domain of the initial mapping both the mapping and its inverse are provably continuous since angle preserving conformal mappings such as abf locally preserve distances as well the planar mapping has small local deformation as result the inverse mapping does not significantly increase the angular distortionthe combined texture mapping procedure provides mapping with low distance and angular distortion which is guaranteed to be continuous

the ultimate challenges of system modeling concern designing accurate yet highly transparent and user centric models we have witnessed plethora of neurofuzzy architectures which are aimed at addressing these two highly conflicting requirements this study is concerned with the design and the development of transparent logic networks realized with the aid of fuzzy neurons and fuzzy unineurons the construction of networks of this form requires formation of efficient interfaces that constitute conceptually appealing bridge between the model and the real world experimental environment in which the model is to be used in general the interfaces are constructed by invoking some form of granulation of information and binary boolean discretization in particular we introduce new discretization environment that is realized by means of particle swarm optimization pso and data clustering implemented by the means algorithm the underlying structure of the network is optimized by invoking combination of the pso and the mechanisms of conventional gradient based learning we discuss various optimization strategies by considering boolean as well as fuzzy data coming as the result of discretization of original experimental data and then involving several learning strategies we elaborate on the interpretation aspects of the network and show how those could be strengthened through efficient pruning we also show how the interpreted network leads to simpler and more accurate logic description of the experimental data number of experimental studies are included

the fair evaluation and comparison of side channel attacks and countermeasures has been long standing open question limiting further developments in the field motivated by this challenge this work makes step in this direction and proposes framework for the analysis of cryptographic implementations that includes theoretical model and an application methodology the model is based on commonly accepted hypotheses about side channels that computations give rise to it allows quantifying the effect of practically relevant leakage functions with combination of information theoretic and security metrics measuring the quality of an implementation and the strength of an adversary respectively from theoretical point of view we demonstrate formal connections between these metrics and discuss their intuitive meaning from practical point of view the model implies unified methodology for the analysis of side channel key recovery attacks the proposed solution allows getting rid of most of the subjective parameters that were limiting previous specialized and often ad hoc approaches in the evaluation of physically observable devices it typically determines the extent to which basic but practically essential questions such as how to compare two implementations or how to compare two side channel adversaries can be answered in sound fashion
with the significant advances in mobile computing technology there is an increasing demand for various mobile applications to process transactions in real time fashion when remote data access is considered in mobile environment data access delay becomes one of the most serious problems in meeting transaction deadlines in this paper we propose multi version data model and adopt the relative consistency as the correctness criterion for processing of real time transactions in mobile environment the purpose is to reduce the impacts of unpredictable and unreliable mobile network on processing of the real time transactions under the proposed model the overheads for concurrency control can be significantly reduced and the data availability is much enhanced even under network failures real time transaction may access stale data provided that they are relatively consistent with the data accessed by the transaction and the staleness of the data is within the requirements an image transaction model which pre fetches multiple data versions at fixed hosts is proposed to reduce the data access delay and to simplify the management of the real time transactions in mobile environment the image transaction model also helps in reducing the transaction restart overheads and minimizing the impacts of the unpredictable performance of mobile network on transaction executions
bisimulation semantics are very pleasant way to define the semantics of systems mainly because the simplicity of their definitions and their nice coalgebraic properties however they also have some disadvantages they are based on sequential operational semantics defined by means of an ordinary transition system and in order to be bisimilar two systems have to be too similar in this work we will present several natural proposals to define weaker bisimulation semantics that we think properly capture the desired behaviour of distributed systems the main virtue of all these semantics is that they are real bisimulation semantics thus inheriting most of the good properties of bisimulation semantics this is so because they can be defined as particular instances of jacobs and hughes categorical definition of simulation which they have already proved to satisfy all those properties

category level object recognition segmentation and tracking in videos becomes highly challenging when applied to sequences from hand held camera that features extensive motion and zooming an additional challenge is then to develop fully automatic video analysis system that works without manual initialization of tracker or other human intervention both during training and during recognition despite background clutter and other distracting objects moreover our working hypothesis states that category level recognition is possible based only on an erratic flickering pattern of interest point locations without extracting additional features compositions of these points are then tracked individually by estimating parametric motion model groups of compositions segment video frame into the various objects that are present and into background clutter objects can then be recognized and tracked based on the motion of their compositions and on the shape they form finally the combination of this flow based representation with an appearance based one is investigated besides evaluating the approach on challenging video categorization database with significant camera motion and clutter we also demonstrate that it generalizes to action recognition in natural way
development of new embedded systems requires tuning of the software applications to specific hardware blocks and platforms as well as to the relevant input data instances the behaviour of these applications heavily relies on the nature of the input data samples thus making them strongly data dependent for this reason it is necessary to extensively profile them with representative samples of the actual input data an important aspect of this profiling is done at the dynamic data type level which actually steers the designers choice of implementation of these data types the behaviour of the applications is then characterized through an analysis phase as collection of software metadata that can be used to optimize the system as whole in this paper we propose to represent the behaviour of data dependent applications to enable optimizations rather than to analyze their structure or to define the engineering process behind them moreover we specifically limit ourselves to the scope of applications dominated by dynamically allocated data types running on embedded systems we characterize the software metadata that these optimizations require and we present methodology as well as appropriate techniques to obtain this information from the original application the optimizations performed on complete case study utilizing the extracted software metadata achieve overall improvements of up to in the number of cycles spent accessing memory when compared to code optimized only with the static techniques applied by gnu

this paper evaluates pointer tainting an incarnation of dynamic information flow tracking dift which has recently become an important technique in system security pointer tainting has been used for two main purposes detection of privacy breaching malware eg trojan keyloggers obtaining the characters typed by user and detection of memory corruption attacks against non control data eg buffer overflow that modifies user's privilege level in both of these cases the attacker does not modify control data such as stored branch targets so the control flow of the target program does not change phrased differently in terms of instructions executed the program behaves normally as result these attacks are exceedingly difficult to detect pointer tainting is considered one of the onlymethods for detecting them in unmodified binaries unfortunately almost all of the incarnations of pointer tainting are flawed in particular we demonstrate that the application of pointer tainting to the detection of keyloggers and other privacybreaching malware is problematic we also discuss whether pointer tainting is able to reliably detect memory corruption attacks against non control data pointer tainting generates itself the conditions for false positives we analyse the problems in detail and investigate various ways to improve the technique most have serious drawbacks in that they are either impractical and incur many false positives still and or cripple the technique's ability to detect attacks in conclusion we argue that depending on architecture and operating system pointer tainting may have some value in detecting memory orruption attacks albeit with false negatives and not on the popular architecture but it is fundamentally not suitable for automated detecting of privacy breaching malware such as keyloggers
common belief in the scientific community is that traffic classifiers based on deep packet inspection dpi are far more expensive in terms of computational complexity compared to statistical classifiers in this paper we counter this notion by defining accurate models for deep packet inspection classifier and statistical one based on support vector machines and by evaluating their actual processing costs through experimental analysis the results suggest that contrary to the common belief dpi classifier and an svm based one can have comparable computational costs although much work is left to prove that our results apply in more general cases this preliminary analysis is first indication of how dpi classifiers might not be as computationally complex compared to other approaches as we previously thought
in recent years both performance and power have become key factors in efficient memory design in this paper we propose systematic approach to reduce the energy consumption of the entire memory hierarchy we first evaluate an existing power aware memory system where memory modules can exist in different power modes and then propose on chip memory module buffers called energy saver buffers esb which reside in between the cache and main memory esbs reduce the additional overhead incurred due to frequent resynchronization of the memory modules in low power state an additional improvement is attained by using model that dynamically resizes the active cache based on the varying needs of program our experimental results demonstrate that an integrated approach can reduce the energy delay product by as much as when compared to traditional non power aware memory hierarchy

focus on organizing and implementing workflows in government from standpoint of data awareness or even data centricity might provide opportunities to address several of the challenges facing governments efforts to improve government effectiveness and efficiency as well as interoperation between government entities the notion of data aware as opposed to data unaware or just process centric workflows is based on taking into account and using the particular enactments and instance specific data in the workflow itself and beyond its single instance in other words on the one hand workflows process data however through their enactments and instances on the other hand workflows are data ready as inputs for other workflows including cross process enactment mining and analyses to be useful as strategy in government we need to explore how data centric approaches can tackle the specific challenges of government such as the ill structured or semi structured workflows found in emergency and disaster response management and we need to better understand the specific constraints under which intra and cross agency data centric workflows can be designed and implemented this paper lays out research agenda that will inform questions about the issues with and the potential of the data centric approach in the context of government
many electronic cash systems have been proposed with the proliferation of the internet and the activation of electronic commerce cash enables the exchange of digital coins with value assured by the bank's signature and with concealed user identity in an electronic cash system user can withdraw coins from the bank and then spends each coin anonymously and unlinkably in this paper we design an efficient anonymous mobile payment system based on bilinear pairings in which the anonymity of coins is revocable by trustee in case of dispute the message transfer from the customer to the merchant occurs only once during the payment protocol also the amount of communication between customer and merchant is about bits therefore our mobile payment system can be used in the wireless networks with the limited bandwidth the security of the new system is under the computational diffie hellman problem in the random oracle model

embedded systems designers are free to choose the most suitable configuration of cache in modern processor based socs choosing the appropriate cache configuration necessitates the simulation of long memory access traces to accurately obtain hit miss rates the long execution time taken to simulate these traces particularly separate simulation for each configuration is major drawback researchers have proposed techniques to speed up the simulation of caches with lru replacement policy these techniques are of little use in the majority of embedded processors as these processors utilize round robin policy based caches in this paper we propose fast cache simulation approach called scud sorted collection of unique data for caches with the round robin policy scud is single pass cache simulator that can simulate multiple cache configurations with varying set sizes and associativities by reading the application trace once utilizing fast binary searches in novel data structure scud simulates an application trace significantly faster than widely used single configuration cache simulator dinero iv we show scud can simulate set of cache configurations up to times faster than dinero iv scud shows an average speed up of times over dinero iv for mediabench applications and an average speed up of over times for spec cpu applications
the frequent items problem is to process stream of items and find all items occurring more than given fraction of the time it is one of the most heavily studied problems in data stream mining dating back to the many applications rely directly or indirectly on finding the frequent items and implementations are in use in large scale industrial systems however there has not been much comparison of the different methods under uniform experimental conditions it is common to find papers touching on this topic in which important related work is mischaracterized overlooked or reinvented in this paper we aim to present the most important algorithms for this problem in common framework we have created baseline implementations of the algorithms and used these to perform thorough experimental study of their properties we give empirical evidence that there is considerable variation in the performance of frequent items algorithms the best methods can be implemented to find frequent items with high accuracy using only tens of kilobytes of memory at rates of millions of items per second on cheap modern hardware
constructing correct concurrent garbage collection algorithms is notoriously hard numerous such algorithms have been proposed implemented and deployed and yet the relationship among them in terms of speed and precision is poorly understood and the validation of one algorithm does not carry over to othersas programs with low latency requirements written in garbagecollected languages become part of society's mission critical infrastructure it is imperative that we raise the level of confidence in the correctness of the underlying system and that we understand the trade offs inherent in our algorithmic choicein this paper we present correctness preserving transformations that can be applied to an initial abstract concurrent garbage collection algorithm which is simpler more precise and easier to prove correct than algorithms used in practice but also more expensive and with less concurrency we then show how both pre existing and new algorithms can be synthesized from the abstract algorithm by series of our transformations we relate the algorithms formally using new definition of precision and informally with respect to overhead and concurrencythis provides many insights about the nature of concurrent collection allows the direct synthesis of new and useful algorithms reduces the burden of proof to single simple algorithm and lays the groundwork for the automated synthesis of correct concurrent collectors
moving and resizing desktop windows are frequently performed but largely unexplored interaction tasks the standard title bar and border dragging techniques used for window manipulation have not changed much over the years we studied three new methods to move and resize windows the new methods are based on proxy and goal crossing techniques to eliminate the need of long cursor movements and acquiring narrow window borders instead moving and resizing actions are performed by manipulating proxy objects close to the cursor and by sweeping cursor motions across window borders we compared these techniques with the standard techniques the results indicate that further investigations and redesigns of window manipulation techniques are worthwhile all new techniques were faster than the standard techniques with task completion times improving more than in some cases also the new resizing techniques were found to be less error prone than the traditional click and drag method
permissive nominal logic pnl is an extension of first order logic where term formers can bind names in their arguments this allows for direct axiomatisations with binders such as the quantifier of first order logic itself and the binder of the lambda calculus this also allows us to finitely axiomatise arithmetic like first and higher order logic and unlike other nominal logics equality reasoning is not necessary to alpha rename all this gives pnl much of the expressive power of higher order logic but terms derivations and models of pnl are first order in character and the logic seems to strike good balance between expressivity and simplicity

despite the fact that global software development gsd is steadily becoming the standard engineering mode in the software industry commercial projects still struggle with how to effectively manage it recent research and our own experiences from numerous gsd projects at capgemini sd indicate that staging the development process with handover checkpoints is promising practice in order to tackle many of the encountered problems in practice in this paper we discuss typical management problems in gsd we describe how handover checkpoints are used at capgemini sd to control and safely manage large gsd projects we show how these handover checkpoints and the use of cohesive and self contained work packages effectively mitigate the discussed management problems we are continuously refining and improving our handover checkpoint approach by applying it within large scale commercial gsd projects we thus believe that the presented results can serve the practitioner as fundament for implementing and customizing handover checkpoints within his own organisation
play on demand is usually regarded as feasible access mode for web content including streaming video web pages and so on web services and some software as service saas applications but not for common desktop applications this paper presents such solution for windows desktop applications based on lightweight virtualization and network transportation technologies which allows user to run her personalized software on any compatible computer across the internet even though they do not exist on local disks of the host in our approach the user's data and their configurations are stored on portable usb device at run time the desktop applications are downloaded from the internet and run in lightweight virtualization environment in which some resource accessing apis such as registry files directories environment variables and the like are intercepted and redirected to the portable device or network as needed because applications are played without installation like streaming media they can be called streaming software moreover to protect software vendors rights access control technologies are used to block any illegal access in the current implementation pp transportation is used as the transport method however our design actually does not rely on pp and another data delivery mechanism like dedicated file server could be employed instead to make the system more predictable this paper describes the design and technical details for this system presents demo application and evaluates it performance the proposed solution is shown to be more efficient in performance and storage capacity than some of the existing solutions based on vm techniques

competitive native solvers for answer set programming asp perform backtracking search by assuming the truth of literals the choice of literals the heuristic is fundamental for the performance of these systems most of the efficient asp systems employ heuristic based on look ahead that is literal is tentatively assumed and its heuristic value is based on its deterministic consequences however looking ahead is costly operation and indeed look ahead often accounts for the majority of time taken by asp solvers for satisfiability sat radically different approach called look back heuristic proved to be quite successful instead of looking ahead one uses information gathered during the computation performed so far thus looking back in this approach atoms which have been frequently involved in inconsistencies are preferred in this paper we carry over this approach to the framework of disjunctive asp we design number of look back heuristics exploiting peculiarities of asp and implement them in the asp system dlv we compare their performance on collection of hard asp programs both structured and randomly generated these experiments indicate that very basic approach works well outperforming all of the prominent disjunctive asp systems dlv with its traditional heuristic gnt and cmodels on many of the instances considered
the widespread presence of simd devices in today's microprocessors has made compiler techniques for these devices tremendously important one of the most important and difficult issues that must be addressed by these techniques is the generation of the data permutation instructions needed for non contiguous and misaligned memory references these instructions are expensive and therefore it is of crucial importance to minimize their number to improve performance and in many cases enable speedups over scalar codealthough it is often difficult to optimize an isolated data reorganization operation collection of related data permutations can often be manipulated to reduce the number of operations this paper presents strategy to optimize all forms of data permutations the strategy is organized into three steps first all data permutations in the source program are converted into generic representation these permutations can originate from vector accesses to non contiguous and misaligned memory locations or result from compiler transformations second an optimization algorithm is applied to reduce the number of data permutations in basic block by propagating permutations across statements and merging consecutive permutations whenever possible the algorithm can significantly reduce the number of data permutations finally code generation algorithm translates generic permutation operations into native permutation instructions for the target platform experiments were conducted on various kinds of applications the results show that up to of the permutation instructions are eliminated and as result the average performance improvement is on vmx and on sse for several applications near perfect speedups have been achieved on both platforms
this paper presents an approach that uses special purpose rbac constraints to base certain access control decisions on context information in our approach context constraint is defined as dynamic rbac constraint that checks the actual values of one or more contextual attributes for predefined conditions if these conditions are satisfied the corresponding access request can be permitted accordingly conditional permission is an rbac permission which is constrained by one or more context constraints we present an engineering process for context constraints that is based on goal oriented requirements engineering techniques and describe how we extended the design and implementation of an existing rbac service to enable the enforcement of context constraints with our approach we aim to preserve the advantages of rbac and offer an additional means for the definition and enforcement of fine grained context dependent access control policies
publish subscribe systems are used increasingly often as communication mechanism in loosely coupled distributed applications with their gradual adoption in mission critical areas it is essential that systems are subjected to rigorous performance analysis before they are put into production however existing approaches to performance modeling and analysis of publish subscribe systems suffer from many limitations that seriously constrain their practical applicability in this paper we present set of generalized and comprehensive analytical models of publish subscribe systems employing different peer to peer and hierarchical routing schemes the proposed analytical models address the major limitations underlying existing work in this area and are the first to consider all major performance relevant system metrics including the expected broker and link utilization the expected notification delay the expected time required for new subscriptions to become fully active as well as the expected routing table sizes and message rates to illustrate our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality we present case study showing how our models can be exploited for capacity planning and performance prediction in realistic scenario

media spaces and videoconference systems are beneficial for connecting separated co workers and providing rich contextual information however image sharing communication tools may also touch on sensitive spots of the human psyche related to personal perceived image issues eg appearance self image self presentation and vanity we conducted two user studies to examine the impact of self image concerns on the use of media spaces and videoconference systems our results suggest that personal perceived image concerns have considerable impact on the comfort level of users and may hinder effective communication we also found that image filtering techniques can help users feel more comfortable our results revealed that distortion filters which are frequently cited to help preserve privacy do not tend to be the ones preferred by users instead users seemed to favor filters that make subtle changes to their appearance or in some instances they preferred to use surrogate instead

some of the most difficult questions to answer when designing distributed application are related to mobility what information to transfer between sites and when and how to transfer it network transparent distribution the property that program's behavior is independent of how it is partitioned among sites does not directly address these questions therefore we propose to extend all language entities with network behavior that enables efficient distributed programming by giving the programmer simple and predictable control over network communication patterns in particular we show how to give objects an arbitrary mobility behavior that is independent of the objects definition in this way the syntax and semantics of objects are the same regardless of whether they are used as stationary servers mobile agents or simply as caches these ideas have been implemented in distributed oz concurrent object oriented language that is state aware and has dataflow synchronization we prove that the implementation of objects in distributed oz is network transparent to satisfy the predictability condition the implementation avoids forwarding chains through intermediate sites the implementation is an extension to the publicly available dfki oz system
many spatiotemporal applications store moving object data in the form of trajectories various recent works have addressed interesting queries on trajectorial data mainly focusing on range queries and nearest neighbor queries here we examine another interesting query the time relaxed spatiotemporal trajectory join trstj which effectively finds groups of moving objects that have followed similar movements in different times we first attempt to address the trstj problem using symbolic representation algorithm which we have recently proposed for trajectory joins however we show experimentally that this solution produces false positives that grow rapidly with the increase of the problem size as result it is inefficient for trstj queries as it leads to large query time overhead in order to improve query performance we propose two important heuristics that turn the symbolic represenation approach effective for trstj queries our first improvement allows the use of multiple origins when processing strings representing trajectories the experimental evaluation shows that the multiple origin approach drastically reduces query performance we then present divide and conquer approach to further reduce false positives through symbolic class separation the proposed solutions can be combined together which leads to even better query performance we present an experimental study revealing the advantages of using these approaches for solving time relaxed spatiotemporal trajectory join queries
divide and conquer programs are easily parallelized by letting the programmer annotate potential parallelism in the form of spawn and sync constructs to achieve efficient program execution the generated work load has to be balanced evenly among the available cpus for single cluster systems random stealing rs is known to achieve optimal load balancing however rs is inefficient when applied to hierarchical wide area systems where multiple clusters are connected via wide area networks wans with high latency and low bandwidthin this paper we experimentally compare rs with existing load balancing strategies that are believed to be efficient for multi cluster systems random pushing and two variants of hierarchical stealing we demonstrate that in practice they obtain less than optimal results we introduce novel load balancing algorithm cluster aware random stealing crs which is highly efficient and easy to implement crs adapts itself to network conditions and job granularities and does not require manually tuned parameters although crs sends more data across the wans it is faster than its competitors for out of test applications with various wan configurations it has at most overhead in run time compared to rs on single large cluster even with high wide area latencies and low wide area bandwidths these strong results suggest that divide and conquer parallelism is useful model for writing distributed supercomputing applications on hierarchical wide area systems

the wireless network community has become increasingly aware of the benefits of data driven link estimation and routing as compared with beacon based approaches but the issue of biased link sampling bls has not been well studied even though it affects routing convergence in the presence of network and environment dynamics focusing on traffic induced dynamics we examine the open unexplored question of how serious the bls issue is and how to effectively address it when the routing metric etx is used for wide range of traffic patterns and network topologies and using both node oriented and network wide analysis and experimentation we discover that the optimal routing structure remains quite stable even though the properties of individual links and routes vary significantly as traffic pattern changes in cases where the optimal routing structure does change data driven link estimation and routing is either guaranteed to converge to the optimal structure or empirically shown to converge to close to optimal structure these findings provide the foundation for addressing the bls issue in the presence of traffic induced dynamics and suggest approaches other than existing ones these findings also demonstrate that it is possible to maintain an optimal stable routing structure despite the fact that the properties of individual links and paths vary in response to network dynamics

choosing good variable order is crucial for making symbolic state space generation algorithms truly efficient one such algorithm is the mdd based saturation algorithm for petri nets implemented in smart whose efficiency relies on exploiting event locality this paper presents novel static ordering heuristic that considers place invariants of petri nets in contrast to related work we use the functional dependencies encoded by invariants to merge decision diagram variables rather than to eliminate them we prove that merging variables always yields smaller mdds and improves event locality while eliminating variables may increase mdd sizes and break locality combining this idea of merging with heuristics for maximizing event locality we obtain an algorithm for static variable order which outperforms competing approaches regarding both time efficiency and memory efficiency as we demonstrate by extensive benchmarking
in this paper we consider the problem of processor allocation on mesh based multiprocessor systems we employ the idea of using migration to minimize fragmentation and the overall processing time of the tasks in our schemes we consider the use of task migration whenever required to improve the problem of fragmentation to this end we propose three efficient schemes to improve the performance of first fit allocation strategies commonly used in practice the first scheme called the first fit mesh bifurcation ffmb scheme attempts to start the search for free submesh from either the bottom left corner or the top left corner of the mesh so as to reduce the amount of fragmentation in the mesh the next two schemes called the online dynamic compaction single corner odc sc and online dynamic compaction four corners odc fc schemes use task migration to improve the performance of existing submesh allocation strategies we perform rigorous simulation experiments based on practical workloads as reported in the literature to quantify all our proposed schemes and compare them against standard schemes existing in the literature based on the results we make clear recommendations on the choice of the strategies
data exchange and virtual data integration have been the subject of several investigations in the recent literature at the same time the notion of peer data management has emerged as powerful abstraction of many forms of flexible and dynamic data centere ddistributed systems although research on the above issues has progressed considerably in the last years clear understanding on how to combine data exchange and data integration in peer data management is still missing this is the subject of the present paper we start our investigation by first proposing novel framework for peer data exchange showing that it is generalization of the classical data exchange setting we also present algorithms for all the relevant data exchange tasks and show that they can all be done in polynomial time with respect to data complexity based on the motivation that typical mappings and integrity constraints found in data integration are not captured by peer data exchange we extend the framework to incorporate these features one of the main difficulties is that the constraints of this new class are not amenable to materialization we address this issue by resorting to suitable combination of virtual and materialized data exchange showing that the resulting framework is generalization of both classical data exchange and classical data integration and that the new setting incorporates the most expressive types of mapping and constraints considered in the two contexts finally we present algorithms for all the relevant data management tasks also in the new setting and show that again their data complexity is polynomial
radiance transfer represents how generic source lighting is shadowed and scattered by an object to produce view dependent appearance we generalize by rendering transfer at two scales macro scale is coarsely sampled over an object's surface providing global effects like shadows cast from an arm onto body meso scale is finely sampled over small patch to provide local texture low order spherical harmonics represent low frequency lighting dependence for both scales to render coefficient vector representing distant source lighting is first transformed at the macro scale by matrix at each vertex of coarse mesh the resulting vectors represent spatially varying hemisphere of lighting incident to the meso scale function called radiance transfer texture rtt then specifies the surface's meso scale response to each lighting basis component as function of spatial index and view direction finally dot product of the macro scale result vector with the vector looked up from the rtt performs the correct shading integral we use an id map to place rtt samples from small patch over the entire object only two scalars are specified at high spatial resolution results show that bi scale decomposition makes preprocessing practical and efficiently renders self shadowing and interreflection effects from dynamic low frequency light sources at both scales
we present multiple pass streaming algorithms for basic clustering problem for massive data sets if our algorithm is allotted passes it will produce an approximation with error at most epsilon using otilde epsilon bits of memory the most critical resource for streaming computation we demonstrate that this tradeoff between passes and memory allotted is intrinsic to the problem and model of computation by proving lower bounds on the memory requirements of any pass randomized algorithm that are nearly matched by our upper bounds to the best of our knowledge this is the first time nearly matching bounds have been proved for such an exponential tradeoff for randomized computationin this problem we are given set of points drawn randomly according to mixture of uniform distributions and wish to approximate the density function of the mixture the points are placed in datastream possibly in adversarial order which may only be read sequentially by the algorithm we argue that this models among others the datastream produced by national census of the incomes of all citizens

interfaces based on recognition technologies are used extensively in both the commercial and research worlds but recognizers are still error prone and this results in human performance problems brittle dialogues and other barriers to acceptance and utility of recognition systems interface techniques specialized to recognition systems can help reduce the burden of recognition errors but building these interfaces depends on knowledge about the ambiguity inherent in recognition we have extended user interface toolkit in order to model and to provide structured support for ambiguity at the input event level this makes it possible to build re usable interface components for resolving ambiguity and dealing with recognition errors these interfaces can help to reduce the negative effects of recognition errors by providing these components at toolkit level we make it easier for application writers to provide good support for error handling further with this robust support we are able to explore new types of interfaces for resolving more varied range of ambiguity

energy consumption is of significant concern in battery operated embedded systems in the processors of such systems the instruction cache consumes significant fraction of the total energy one of the most popular methods to reduce the energy consumption is to shut down idle cache banks however we observe that operating idle cache banks at reduced voltage frequency level along with the active banks in pipelined manner can potentially achieve even better energy savings in this paper we propose novel dvs based pipelined reconfigurable instruction memory hierarchy called prim canonical example of our proposed prim consists of four cache banks two of these cache banks can be configured at runtime to operate at lower voltage and frequency levels than that of the normal cache instruction fetch throughput is maintained by pipelining the accesses to the low voltage banks we developed profile driven compilation framework that analyzes applications and inserts the appropriate cache reconfiguration points our experimental results show that prim can significant reduce the energy consumption for popular embedded benchmarks with minimal performance overhead we obtained and energy savings for aggressive and conservative vdd settings respectively at the expense of performance overhead
software defect prediction is important for reducing test times by allocating testing resources effectively in terms of predicting the defects in software naive bayes outperforms wide range of other methods however naive bayes assumes the independence and equal importance of attributes in this work we analyze these assumptions of naive bayes using public software defect data from nasa our analysis shows that independence assumption is not harmful for software defect data with pca pre processing our results also indicate that assigning weights to static code attributes may increase the prediction performance significantly while removing the need for feature subset selection
this paper presents fundamentally new approach to integrating local decisions from various nodes and efficiently routing data in sensor networks by classifying the nodes in the sensor field as hot or cold in accordance with whether or not they sense the target we are able to concentrate on smaller set of nodes and gear the routing of data to and from the sink to fraction of the nodes that exist in the network the introduction of this intermediary step is fundamentally new and allows for efficient and meaningful fusion and routing this is made possible through the use of novel markov random field mrf approach which to the best of our knowledge has never been applied to sensor networks in combination with maximum posteriori probability map stochastic relaxation tools to flag out the hot nodes in the network and to optimally combine their data and decisions towards an integrated and collaborative global decision fusion this global decision supersedes all local decisions and provides the basis for efficient use of the sensed data because of the mrf local nature nodes need not see or interact with other nodes in the sensor network beyond their immediate neighborhood which can either be defined in terms of distance between nodes or communication connectivity hence adding to the flexibility of dealing with irregular and varying sensor topologies and also minimizing node power usage and providing for easy scalability the routing of the hot nodes data is confined to cone of nodes and power constraints are taken into account we also use the found location of the centroid of the hot nodes over time to track the movement of the target this is achieved by using the segmentation at time as an initial state in the stochastic map relaxation at time dt
pen gesture interfaces have difficulty supporting arbitrary multiple stroke selections because lifting the pen introduces ambiguity as to whether the next stroke should add to the existing selection or begin new one we explore and evaluate techniques that use non preferred hand button or touchpad to phrase together one or more independent pen strokes into unitary multi stroke gesture we then illustrate how such phrasing techniques can support multiple stroke selection gestures with tapping crossing lassoing disjoint selection circles of exclusion selection decorations and implicit grouping operations these capabilities extend the expressiveness of pen gesture interfaces and suggest new directions for multiple stroke pen input techniques

this paper considers new security protocol paradigm whereby principals negotiate and on the fly generate security protocols according to their needs when principals wish to interact then rather than offering each other fixed menu of known protocols they negotiate and possibly with the collaboration of other principles synthesise new protocol that is tailored specifically to their current security environment and requirements this approach provides basis for autonomic security protocols such protocols are self configuring since only principal assumptions and protocol goals need to be priori configured the approach has the potential to survive security compromises that can be modelled as changes in the beliefs of the principals compromise of key or change in the trust relationships between principals can result in principal self healing and synthesising new protocol to survive the event

one purpose of software metrics is to measure the quality of programs the results can be for example used to predict maintenance costs or improve code quality an emerging view is that if software metrics are going to be used to improve quality they must help in finding code that should be refactored often refactoring or applying design pattern is related to the role of the class to be refactored in client based metrics project gives the class context these metrics measure how class is used by other classes in the context we present new client based metric lcic lack of coherence in clients which analyses if the class being measured has coherent set of roles in the program interfaces represent the roles of classes if class does not have coherent set of roles it should be refactored or new interface should be defined for the class we have implemented tool for measuring the metric lcic for java projects in the eclipse environment we calculated lcic values for classes of several open source projects we compare these results with results of other related metrics and inspect the measured classes to find out what kind of refactorings are needed we also analyse the relation of different design patterns and refactorings to our metric our experiments reveal the usefulness of client based metrics to improve the quality of code

the geographic routing is an ideal approach to realize pointto point routing in wireless sensor networks because packets can be delivered by only maintaining small set of neighbors physical positions the geographic routing assumes that packet can be moved closer to the destination in the network topology if it is moved geographically closer to the destination in the physical space this assumption however only holds in an ideal model where uniformly distributed nodes communicate with neighbors through wireless channels with perfect reception because this model oversimplifies the spatial complexity of wireless sensor network the geographic routing may often lead packet to the local minimum or low quality route unlike the geographic forwarding the etx embedding proposed in this paper can accurately encode both network's topological structure and channel quality to small size nodes virtual coordinates which makes it possible for greedy forwarding to guide packet along an optimal routing path our performance evaluation based on both the mica sensor platform and tossim simulator shows that the greedy forwarding based on etx embedding outperforms previous geographic routing approaches
soft real time systems can tolerate some occasional deadline misses this feature provides unique opportunity to reduce system's energy consumption in this paper we study the system with firm deadline popular model for soft real time systems it basically requires at least successful completions in any consecutive executions our goal is to design such system with dual supply voltages for energy efficiency to reach this goal we first propose an on line greedy deterministic scheduler that provides the firm guarantee with the provably minimum energy consumption we then develop novel exact method to compute the scheduler's average energy consumption per iteration this leads us to the numerical solution to the voltage set up problem which seeks for the values of the two supply voltages to achieve the most energy efficiency with firm guarantee simulation shows that dual voltage system can reduce significant amount of energy over single voltage system our numerical method finds the best voltage set ups in seconds while it takes hours to obtain almost identical solutions by simulation
in this paper we describe how the memory management mechanisms of the intel iapx are used to implement the visibility rules of ada at any point in the execution of an ada reg program on the the program has protected address space that corresponds exactly to the program's accessibility at the corresponding point in the program's source this close match of architecture and language did not occur because the was designed to execute ada mdash it was not rather both ada and the are the result of very similar design goals to illustrate this point we compare in their support for ada the memory management mechanisms of the to those of traditional computers the most notable differences occur in heap space management and multitasking with respect to the former we describe degree of hardware software cooperation that is not typical of other systems in the latter area we show how ada's view of sharing is the same as the but differs totally from the sharing permitted by traditional systems description of these differences provide some insight into the problems of implementing an ada compiler for traditional architecture
the diffusion of mobile devices in the working landscape is promoting collaboration across time and space following through this development we investigate opportunities for improving awareness in mobile environments with view to enable collaboration under power constraints and transitory network disconnections we elaborate in particular on synchronous cscw and expose with it significant details of group awareness while we contribute protocol for awareness support over large areas that strikes balance between energy consumption and notification time to avoid user disruption this protocol notifies awareness information in multicast fashion while the bandwidth is allocated dynamically among notifications and data requests thus minimizing the time needed by each one of them and ensuring the isochronous delivery of information to all clients the efficiency and scalability of our protocol are evaluated with simulation experiments whereby we compare various notification schemes and finally choose one that changes dynamically over time
the advances in wireless and mobile computing allow mobile user to perform wide range of aplications once limited to non mobile hard wired computing environments as the geographical position of mobile user is becoming more trackable users need to pull data which are related to their location perhaps seeking information about unfamiliar places or local lifestyle data in these requests location attribute has to be identified in order to provide more efficient access to location dependent data whose value is determined by the location to which it is related local yellow pages local events and weather information are some of the examples of these data in this paper we give formalization of location relatedness in queries we differentiate location dependence and location awareness and provide thorough examples to support our approach
power consumption is major factor that limits the performance of computers we survey the ldquo state of the art rdquo in techniques that reduce the total power consumed by microprocessor system over time these techniques are applied at various levels ranging from circuits to architectures architectures to system software and system software to applications they also include holistic approaches that will become more important over the next decade we conclude that power management is multifaceted discipline that is continually expanding with new techniques being developed at every level these techniques may eventually allow computers to break through the ldquo power wall rdquo and achieve unprecedented levels of performance versatility and reliability yet it remains too early to tell which techniques will ultimately solve the power problem
automatic localisation of correspondences for the construction of statistical shape models from examples has been the focus of intense research during the last decade several algorithms are available and benchmarking is needed to rank the different algorithms prior work has argued that the quality of the models produced by the algorithms can be evaluated by measuring compactness generality and specificity in this paper severe problems with these standard measures are analysed both theoretically and experimentally both on natural and synthetic datasets we also propose that ground truth correspondence measure gcm is used for benchmarking and in this paper benchmarking is performed on several state of the art algorithms using seven real and one synthetic dataset

data integration is the problem of combining data residing at different autonomous heterogeneous sources and providing the client with unified reconciled global view of the data we discuss data integration systems taking the abstract viewpoint that the global view is an ontology expressed in class based formalism we resort to an expressive description logic alcqi that fully captures class based representation formalisms and we show that query answering in data integration as well as all other relevant reasoning tasks is decidable however when we have to deal with large amounts of data the high computational complexity in the size of the data makes the use of full fledged expressive description logic infeasible in practice this leads us to consider dl lite specifically tailored restriction of alcqi that ensures tractability of query answering in data integration while keeping enough expressive power to capture the most relevant features of class based formalisms

labeling text data is quite time consuming but essential for automatic text classification especially manually creating multiple labels for each document may become impractical when very large amount of data is needed for training multi label text classifiers to minimize the human labeling efforts we propose novel multi label active learning approach which can reduce the required labeled data without sacrificing the classification accuracy traditional active learning algorithms can only handle single label problems that is each data is restricted to have one label our approach takes into account the multi label information and select the unlabeled data which can lead to the largest reduction of the expected model loss specifically the model loss is approximated by the size of version space and the reduction rate of the size of version space is optimized with support vector machines svm an effective label prediction method is designed to predict possible labels for each unlabeled data point and the expected loss for multi label data is approximated by summing up losses on all labels according to the most confident result of label prediction experiments on several real world data sets all are publicly available demonstrate that our approach can obtain promising classification result with much fewer labeled data than state of the art methods
this paper introduces novel technique for joint surface reconstruction and registration given set of roughly aligned noisy point clouds it outputs noise free and watertight solid model the basic idea of the new technique is to reconstruct prototype surface at increasing resolution levels according to the registration accuracy obtained so far and to register all parts with this surface we derive non linear optimization problem from bayesian formulation of the joint estimation problem the prototype surface is represented as partition of unity implicit surface which is constructed from piecewise quadratic functions defined on octree cells and blended together using spline basis functions allowing the representation of objects with arbitrary topology with high accuracy we apply the new technique to set of standard data sets as well as especially challenging real world cases in practice the novel prototype surface based joint reconstruction registration algorithm avoids typical convergence problems in registering noisy range scans and substantially improves the accuracy of the final output
we study traffic measurement issue for active queue management and dynamic bandwidth allocation at single network node under the constraint of cell loss probability clp or buffer overflow probability using the concept of measurement based virtual queue vq and frequency domain traffic filtering we propose an online algorithm to estimate the real time bandwidth demand under both short and long term cell loss constraint the algorithm is adaptive and robust to the piece wise stationary traffic dynamics the vq runs in parallel to the real queueing system and monitors the latter in non intrusive way it captures proper traffic sampling interval tc simulation and analysis show its critical role in achieving higher utilization of bandwidth and buffer resource without violating qos requirement given an appropriate tc we argue that network controls such as the call admission control cac and dynamic bandwidth allocation are facilitated with accurate information about traffic loading and qos status at the smallest timescale
two methods have been used extensively to model resting contact for rigid body simulation the first approach the penalty method applies virtual springs to surfaces in contact to minimize interpenetration this method as typically implemented results in oscillatory behavior and considerable penetration the second approach based on formulating resting contact as linear complementarity problem determines the resting contact forces analytically to prevent interpenetration the analytical method exhibits expected case polynomial complexity in the number of contact points and may fail to find solution in polynomial time when friction is modeled we present fast penalty method that minimizes oscillatory behavior and leads to little penetration during resting contact our method compares favorably to the analytical method with regard to these two measures while exhibiting much faster performance both asymptotically and empirically
this paper proposes cluster based peer to peer system called peercluster for sharing data over the internet in peercluster all participant computers are grouped into various interest clusters each of which contains computers that have the same interests the intuition behind the system design is that by logically grouping users interested in similar topics together we can improve query efficiency to efficiently route and broadcast messages across within interest clusters hypercube topology is employed in addition to ensure that the structure of the interest clusters is not altered by arbitrary node insertions deletions we have devised corresponding join and leave protocols the complexities of these protocols are analyzed moreover we augment peercluster with system recovery mechanism to make it robust against unpredictable computer network failures using an event driven simulation we evaluate the performance of our approach by varying several system parameters the experimental results show that peercluster outperforms previous approaches in terms of query efficiency while still providing the desired functionality of keyword based search
grid resource management has been traditionally limited to just two levels of hierarchy namely local resource managers and metaschedulers this results in non manageable and thus not scalable architecture where each metascheduler has to be able to access thousands of resources which also implies having detailed knowledge about their interfaces and configuration this paper presents recursive architecture allowing an arbitrary number of levels in the hierarchy this way resources can be arranged in different ways for example following organizational boundaries or aggregating them by similarity while hiding the access details an implementation of this architecture is shown as well as its benefits in terms of autonomy scalability deployment and security the proposed implementation is based on existing interfaces allowing for standardization
tail calls are expected not to consume stack space in most functional languages however there is no support for tail calls in some environments even in such environments proper tail calls can be implemented with technique called trampoline to reduce the overhead of trampolining while preserving stack space asymptotically we propose selective tail call elimination based on an effect system the effect system infers the number of successive tail calls generated by the execution of an expression and trampolines are introduced only when they are necessary

finding frequent patterns in continuous stream of transactions is critical for many applications such as retail market data analysis network monitoring web usage mining and stock market prediction even though numerous frequent pattern mining algorithms have been developed over the past decade new solutions for handling stream data are still required due to the continuous unbounded and ordered sequence of data elements generated at rapid rate in data stream therefore extracting frequent patterns from more recent data can enhance the analysis of stream data in this paper we propose an efficient technique to discover the complete set of recent frequent patterns from high speed data stream over sliding window we develop compact pattern stream tree cps tree to capture the recent stream data content and efficiently remove the obsolete old stream data content we also introduce the concept of dynamic tree restructuring in our cps tree to produce highly compact frequency descending tree structure at runtime the complete set of recent frequent patterns is obtained from the cps tree of the current window using an fp growth mining technique extensive experimental analyses show that our cps tree is highly efficient in terms of memory and time complexity when finding recent frequent patterns from high speed data stream
initial algebra semantics is cornerstone of the theory of modern functional programming languages for each inductive data type it provides fold combinator encapsulating structured recursion over data of that type church encoding build combinator which constructs data of that type and fold build rule which optimises modular programs by eliminating intermediate data of that type it has long been thought that initial algebra semantics is not expressive enough to provide similar foundation for programming with nested types specifically the folds have been considered too weak to capture commonly occurring patterns of recursion and no church encodings build combinators or fold build rules have been given for nested types this paper overturns this conventional wisdom by solving all of these problems
existing test suite reduction techniques employed for testing web applications have either used traditional program coverage based requirements or usage based requirements in this paper we explore three different strategies to integrate the use of program coverage based requirements and usage based requirements in relation to test suite reduction for web applications we investigate the use of usage based test requirements for comparison of test suites that have been reduced based on program coverage based test requirements we examine the effectiveness of test suite reduction process based on combination of both usage based and program coverage based requirements finally we modify popular test suite reduction algorithm to replace part of its test selection process with selection based on usage based test requirements our case study suggests that integrating program coverage based and usage based test requirements has positive impact on the effectiveness of the resulting test suites

in practice any database management system sometimes needs reorganization that is change in some aspect of the logical and or physical arrangement of database in traditional practice many types of reorganization have required denying access to database taking the database offline during reorganization taking database offline can be unacceptable for highly available hour database for example database serving electronic commerce or armed forces or for very large database solution is to reorganize online concurrently with usage of the database incrementally during users activities or interpretively this article is tutorial and survey on requirements issues and strategies for online reorganization it analyzes the issues and then presents the strategies which use the issues the issues most of which involve design trade offs include use of partitions the locus of control for the process that reorganizes background process or users activities reorganization by copying to newly allocated storage as opposed to reorganizing in place use of differential files references to data that has moved performance and activation of reorganization the article surveys online strategies in three categories of reorganization the first category maintenance involves restoring the physical arrangement of data instances without changing the database definition this category includes restoration of clustering reorganization of an index rebalancing of parallel or distributed data garbage collection for persistent storage and cleaning reclamation of space in log structured file system the second category involves changing the physical database definition topics include construction of indexes conversion between trees and linear hash files and redefinition eg splitting of partitions the third category involves changing the logical database definition some examples are changing column's data type changing the inheritance hierarchy of object classes and changing relationship from one to many to many to many the survey encompasses both research and commercial implementations and this article points out several open research topics as highly available or very large databases continue to become more common and more important in the world economy the importance of online reorganization is likely to continue growing

semantic annotations of web services can support the effective and efficient discovery of services and guide their composition into workflows at present however the practical utility of such annotations is limited by the small number of service annotations available for general use manual annotation of services is time consuming and thus expensive task so some means are required by which services can be automatically or semi automatically annotated in this paper we show how information can be inferred about the semantics of operation parameters based on their connections to other annotated operation parameters within tried and tested workflows because the data links in the workflows do not necessarily contain every possible connection of compatible parameters we can infer only constraints on the semantics of parameters we show that despite their imprecise nature these so called loose annotations are still of value in supporting the manual annotation task inspecting workflows and discovering services we also show that derived annotations for already annotated parameters are useful by comparing existing and newly derived annotations of operation parameters we can support the detection of errors in existing annotations the ontology used for annotation and in workflows the derivation mechanism has been implemented and its practical applicability for inferring new annotations has been established through an experimental evaluation the usefulness of the derived annotations is also demonstrated

pointer analysis classic problem in software program analysis has emerged as an important problem to solve in design automation at time when complex designs specified in the form of code need to be synthesized or verified however precise pointer analysis algorithms that are both context and flow sensitive fscs have not been shown to scale in this paper we report new solution for fscs analysis which can evaluate the program states of all program points under billions of different calling paths our solution extends the recently proposed symbolic pointer analysis spa technology which exploits the efficiency of binary decision diagrams bdds with our new strategy of problem solving called superposed symbolic computation and its application on our generic pointer analysis framework we are able to report the first result on all spec benchmarks that completes context sensitive flow insensitive analysis in seconds and context sensitive flow sensitive analysis in minutes
we present novel technique called radiance scaling for the depiction of surface shape through shading it adjusts reflected light intensities in way dependent on both surface curvature and material characteristics as result diffuse shading or highlight variations become correlated to surface feature variations enhancing surface concavities and convexities this approach is more versatile compared to previous methods first it produces satisfying results with any kind of material we demonstrate results obtained with phong and ashikmin brdfs cartoon shading sub lambertian materials and perfectly reflective or refractive objects second it imposes no restriction on lighting environment it does not require dense sampling of lighting directions and works even with single light third it makes it possible to enhance surface shape through the use of precomputed radiance data such as ambient occlusion prefiltered environment maps or lit spheres our novel approach works in real time on modern graphics hardware
mobile nodes in some challenging network scenarios eg battlefield and disaster recovery scenarios suffer from intermittent connectivity and frequent partitions disruption tolerant network dtn technologies are designed to enable communications in such environments several dtn routing schemes have been proposed however not much work has been done on designing schemes that provide efficient information access in such challenging network scenarios in this paper we explore how content based information retrieval system can be designed for dtns there are three important design issues namely how data should be replicated and stored at multiple nodes how query is disseminated in sparsely connected networks and how query response is routed back to the issuing node we first describe how to select nodes for storing the replicated copies of data items we consider the random and the intelligent caching schemes in the random caching scheme nodes that are encountered first by data generating node are selected to cache the extra copies while in the intelligent caching scheme nodes that can potentially meet more nodes eg faster nodes are selected to cache the extra data copies the number of replicated data copies can be the same for all data items or varied depending on the access frequencies of the data items in this work we consider fixed proportional and square root replication schemes then we describe two query dissemination schemes copy selective query spraying wss scheme and hop neighborhood spraying lns scheme in the wss scheme nodes that can move faster are selected to cache the queries while in the lns scheme nodes that are within hops of querying node will cache the queries for message routing we use an enhanced prophet scheme where next hop node is selected only if its predicted delivery probability to the destination is higher than certain threshold we conduct extensive simulation studies to evaluate different combinations of the replication and query dissemination algorithms our results reveal that the scheme that performs the best is the one that uses the wss scheme combined with binary spread of replicated data copies the wss scheme can achieve higher query success ratio when compared to scheme that does not use any data and query replication furthermore the square root and proportional replication schemes provide higher query success ratio than the fixed copy approach with varying node density in addition the intelligent caching approach can further improve the query success ratio by with varying node density our results using different mobility models reveal that the query success ratio degrades at most when the community based model is used compared to the random waypoint rwp model broch et al performance comparison of multihop wireless ad hoc network routing protocols acm mobicom pp compared to the rwp and the community based mobility models the umassbusnet model from the dieselnet project zhang et al modeling of bus based disruption tolerant network trace proceedings of acm mobihoc achieves much lower query success ratio because of the longer inter node encounter time

one approach to prolong the lifetime of wireless sensor network wsn is to deploy some relay nodes to communicate with the sensor nodes other relay nodes and the base stations the relay node placement problem for wireless sensor networks is concerned with placing minimum number of relay nodes into wireless sensor network to meet certain connectivity or survivability requirements previous studies have concentrated on the unconstrained version of the problem in the sense that relay nodes can be placed anywhere in practice there may be some physical constraints on the placement of relay nodes to address this issue we study constrained versions of the relay node placement problem where relay nodes can only be placed at set of candidate locations in the connected relay node placement problem we want to place minimum number of relay nodes to ensure that each sensor node is connected with base station through bidirectional path in the survivable relay node placement problem we want to place minimum number of relay nodes to ensure that each sensor node is connected with two base stations or the only base station in case there is only one base station through two node disjoint bidirectional paths for each of the two problems we discuss its computational complexity and present framework of polynomial time approximation algorithms with small approximation ratios extensive numerical results showthat our approximation algorithms can produce solutions very close to optimal solutions
we propose low leakage cache architecture based on the observation of the spatio temporal properties of data caches in particular we exploit the fact that during the program lifetime few data values tend to exhibit both spatial and temporal locality in cache ie values that are simultaneously stored by several lines at the same time leakage energy can be reduced by turning off those lines and storing these values in smaller separate memory in this work we introduce an architecture that implements such scheme as well as an algorithm to detect these special values we show that by using as few as four values we can achieve leakage energy savings with an additional reduction of dynamic energy as consequence of reduced average cache access cost
in november the fcc ruled that the digital tv whitespaces be used for unlicensed access this is an exciting development because dtv whitespaces are in the low frequency range mhz compared to typical cellular and ism bands thus resulting in much better propagation characteristics and much higher spectral efficiencies the fcc has also mandated certain guidelines for short range unlicensed access so as to avoid any interference to dtv receivers we consider the problem of wifi like access popularly referred to as wifi for enterprizes we assume that the access points and client devices are equipped with cognitive radios ie they can adaptively choose the center frequency bandwidth and ower of operation the access points can be equipped with one or more radios our goal is to design complete system which does not violate the fcc mandate ii dynamically assigns center frequency and bandwidth to each access point based on their demands and iii squeezes the maximum efficiency from the available spectrum this problem is far more general than prior work that investigated dynamic spectrum allocation in cellular and ism bands due to the non homogenous nature of the whitespaces ie different whitespace widths in different parts of the spectrum and the large range of frequency bands with different propagation characteristics this calls for more holistic approach to system design that also accounts for frequency dependent propagation characteristics and radio frontend characteristics in this paper we first propose design rules for holistic system design we then describe an architecture derived from our design rules finally we propose demand based dynamic spectrum allocation algorithms with provable worst case guarantees we provide extensive simulation results showing that the performance of our algorithm is within of the optimal in typical settings and ii and the dtv whitespaces can provide significantly higher data rates compared to the ghz ism band our approach is general enough for designing any system with access to wide range of spectrum
opinion mining is the task of extracting from set of documents opinions expressed by source on specified target this article presents comparative study on the methods and resources that can be employed for mining opinions from quotations reported speech in newspaper articles we show the difficulty of this task motivated by the presence of different possible targets and the large variety of affect phenomena that quotes contain we evaluate our approaches using annotated quotations extracted from news provided by the emm news gathering engine we conclude that generic opinion mining system requires both the use of large lexicons as well as specialised training and testing data
we consider the setting of multiprocessor where the speeds of the processors can be individually scaled jobs arrive over time and have varying degrees of parallelizability nonclairvoyant scheduler must assign the jobs to processors and scale the speeds of the processors we consider the objective of energy plus flow time for jobs that may have side effects or that are not checkpointable we show an bound on the competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm here is the number of processors and is the exponent of the power function for checkpointable jobs without side effects we give an log competitive algorithm thus for jobs that may have side effects or that are not checkpointable the achievable competitive ratio grows quickly with the number of processors but for checkpointable jobs without side effects the achievable competitive ratio grows slowly with the number of processors we then show lower bound of log on the competitive ratio of any algorithm for checkpointable jobs without side effects finally we slightly improve the upper bound on the competitive ratio for the single processor case which is equivalent to the case that all jobs are fully parallelizable by giving an improved analysis of previously proposed algorithm

the state explosion problem of formal verification has obstructed its application to large scale software systems in this article we introduce set of new condensation theories iot failure equivalence iot state equivalence and firing dependence theory to cope with this problem our condensation theories are much weaker than current theories used for the compositional verification of petri nets more significantly our new condensation theories can eliminate the interleaved behaviors caused by asynchronously sending actions therefore our technique provides much more powerful means for the compositional verification of asynchronous processes our technique can efficiently analyze several state based properties boundedness reachable markings reachable submarkings and deadlock states based on the notion of our new theories we develop set of condensation rules for efficient verification of large scale software systems the experimental results show significant improvement in the analysis large scale concurrent systems
we consider the distribution of channels of live multimedia content eg radio or tv broadcasts via multiple content aggregators in our work an aggregator receives channels from content sources and redistributes them to potentially large number of mobile hosts each aggregator can offer channel in various configurations to cater for different wireless links mobile hosts and user preferences as result mobile host can generally choose from different configurations of the same channel offered by multiple alternative aggregators which may be available through different interfaces eg in hotspot mobile host may need to handoff to another aggregator once it receives channel to prevent service disruption mobile host may for instance need to handoff to another aggregator when it leaves the subnets that make up its current aggregator's service area eg hotspot or cellular network in this paper we present the design of system that enables multi homed mobile hosts to seamlessly handoff from one aggregator to another so that they can continue to receive channel wherever they go we concentrate on handoffs between aggregators as result of mobile host crossing subnet boundary as part of the system we discuss lightweight application level protocol that enables mobile hosts to select the aggregator that provides the best configuration of channel the protocol comes into play when mobile host begins to receive channel and when it crosses subnet boundary while receiving the channel we show how our protocol can be implemented using the standard ietf session control and description protocols sip and sdp the implementation combines sip and sdp's offer answer model in novel way

in multiuser multimedia information systems eg movie on demand digital editing scheduling the retrievals of continuous media objects becomes challenging task this is because of both intra and inter iobject time dependencies intraobject time dependency refers to the real time display requirement of continuous media object interobject time dependency is the temporal relationships defined among multiple continuous media objects in order to compose tailored multimedia presentations user might define complex time dependencies among multiple continuous media objects with various lengths and display bandwidths scheduling the retrieval tasks corresponding to the components of such presentation in order to respect both inter and intra task time dependencies is the focus of this study to tackle this task scheduling problem crs we start with simpler scheduling problem ars where there is no inter task time dependency eg movie on demand next we investigate an augmented version of ars termed ars where requests reserve displays in advance eg reservation based movie on demand finally we extend our techniques proposed for ars and ars to address the crs problem we also provide formal definition of these scheduling problems and proof of their np hardness
in automatic software verification we have observed theoretical convergence of model checking and program analysis in practice however model checkers are still mostly concerned with precision eg the removal of spurious counterexamples for this purpose they build and refine reachability trees lattice based program analyzers on the other hand are primarily concerned with efficiency we designed an algorithm and built tool that can be configured to perform not only purely tree based or purely lattice based analysis but offers many intermediate settings that have not been evaluated before the algorithm and tool take one or more abstract interpreters such as predicate abstraction and shape analysis and configure their execution and interaction using several parameters our experiments show that such customization may lead to dramatic improvements in the precision efficiency spectrum
in web database that dynamically provides information in response to user queries two distinct schemas interface schema the schema users can query and result schema the schema users can browse are presented to users each partially reflects the actual schema of the web database most previous work only studied the problem of schema matching across query interfaces of web databases in this paper we propose novel schema model that distinguishes the interface and the result schema of web database in specific domain in this model we address two significant web database schema matching problems intra site and inter site the first problem is crucial in automatically extracting data from web databases while the second problem plays significant role in meta retrieving and integrating data from different web databases we also investigate unified solution to the two problems based on query probing and instance based schema matching techniques using the model cross validation technique is also proposed to improve the accuracy of the schema matching our experiments on real web databases demonstrate that the two problems can be solved simultaneously with high precision and recall
in this paper we propose run time strategy for allocating application tasks to embedded multiprocessor systems on chip platforms where communication happens via the network on chip approach as novel contribution we incorporate the user behavior information in the resource allocation process this allows the system to better respond to real time changes and to adapt dynamically to different user needs several algorithms are proposed for solving the task allocation problem while minimizing the communication energy consumption and network contention when the user behavior is taken into consideration we observe more than communication energy savings with negligible energy and run time overhead compared to an arbitrary contiguous task allocation strategy
automatically recognising which html documents on the web contain items of interest for user is non trivial as step toward solving this problem we propose an approach based on information extraction ontologies given html documents tables and forms our document recognition system extracts expected ontological vocabulary keywords and keyword phrases and expected ontological instance data particular values for ontological concepts we then use machine learned rules over this extracted information to determine whether an html document contains items of interest experimental results show that our ontological approach to categorisation works well having achieved measures above for all applications we tried
we present new approach to accelerate collision detection for deformable models our formulation applies to all triangulated models and significantly reduces the number of elementary tests between features of the mesh ie vertices edges and faces we introduce the notion of representative triangles standard geometric triangles augmented with mesh feature information and use this representation to achieve better collision query performance the resulting approach can be combined with bounding volume hierarchies and works well for both inter object and self collision detection we demonstrate the benefit of representative triangles on continuous collision detection for cloth simulation and body collision scenarios we observe up to one order of magnitude reduction in feature pair tests and up to improvement in query time

there has been little research into how end users might be able to communicate advice to machine learning systems if this resource the users themselves could somehow work hand in hand with machine learning systems the accuracy of learning systems could be improved and the users understanding and trust of the system could improve as well we conducted think aloud study to see how willing users were to provide feedback and to understand what kinds of feedback users could give users were shown explanations of machine learning predictions and asked to provide feedback to improve the predictions we found that users had no difficulty providing generous amounts of feedback the kinds of feedback ranged from suggestions for reweighting of features to proposals for new features feature combinations relational features and wholesale changes to the learning algorithm the results show that user feedback has the potential to significantly improve machine learning systems but that learning algorithms need to be extended in several ways to be able to assimilate this feedback

bitwise operations are commonly used in low level systems code to access multiple data fields that have been packed into single word program analysis tools that reason about such programs must model the semantics of bitwise operations precisely in order to capture program control and data flow through these operations we present type system for subword data structures that explitictly tracks the flow of bit values in the program and identifies consecutive sections of bits as logical entities manipulated atomically by the programmer our type inference algorithm tags each integer value of the program with bitvector type that identifies the data layout at the subword level these types are used in translation phase to remove bitwise operations from the program thereby allowing verification engines to avoid the expensive low level reasoning required for analyzing bitvector operations we have used software model checker to check properties of translated versions of linux device driver and memory protection system the resulting verification runs could prove many more properties than the naive model checker that did not reason about bitvectors and could prove properties much faster than model checker that did reason about bitvectors we have also applied our bitvector type inference algorithm to generate program documentation for virtual memory subsystem of an os kernel while we have applied the type system mainly for program understanding and verification bitvector types also have applications to better variable ordering heuristics in boolean model checking and memory optimizations in compilers for embedded software
in art grouping plays major role to convey relationships of objects and the organization of scenes it is separated from style which only determines how groups are rendered to achieve visual abstraction of the depicted scene we present an approach to interactively derive grouping information in dynamic scene our solution is simple and general the resulting grouping information can be used as an input to any rendering style we provide an efficient solution based on an extended mean shift algorithm customized by user defined criteria the resulting system is temporally coherent and real time the computational cost is largely determined by the scene's structure rather than by its geometric complexity
this paper describes an approach spy to recovering the specification of software component from the observation of its run time behavior it focuses on components that behave as data abstractions components are assumed to be black boxes that do not allow any implementation inspection the inferred description may help understand what the component does when no formal specification is available spy works in two main stages first it builds deterministic finite state machine that models the partial behavior of instances of the data abstraction this is then generalized via graph transformation rules the rules can generate possibly infinite number of behavior models which generalize the description of the data abstraction under an assumption of regularity with respect to the observed behavior the rules can be viewed as likely specification of the data abstraction we illustrate how spy works on relevant examples and we compare it with competing methods
this paper presents concept hierarchy based approach to privacy preserving data collection for data mining called the level model the level model allows data providers to divulge information at any chosen privacy level level on any attribute data collected at high level signifies divulgence at higher conceptual level and thus ensures more privacy providing guarantees prior to release such as satisfying anonymity samarati sweeney can further protect the collected data set from privacy breaches due to linking the released data set with external data sets however the data mining process which involves the integration of various data values can constitute privacy breach if combinations of attributes at certain levels result in the inference of knowledge that exists at lower level this paper describes the level reduction phenomenon and proposes methods to identify and control the occurrence of this privacy breach
replay is an important technique in program analysis allowing to reproduce bugs to track changes and to repeat executions for better understanding of the results unfortunately since re executing concurrent program does not necessarily produce the same ordering of events replay of such programs becomes difficult task the most common approach to replay of concurrent programs is based on analyzing the logical dependencies among concurrent events and requires complete recording of the execution we are trying to replay as well as complete control over the program's scheduler in realistic settings we usually have only partial recording of the execution and only partial control over the scheduling decisions thus such an analysis is often impossible in this paper we present an approach for replay in the presence of partial information and partial control our approach is based on novel application of the cross entropy method and it does not require any logical analysis of dependencies among concurrent events roughly speaking given partial recording of an execution we define performance function on executions which reaches its maximum on or any other execution that coincides with on the recorded events then the program is executed many times in iterations on each iteration adjusting the probabilistic scheduling decisions so that the performance function is maximized our method is also applicable to debugging of concurrent programs in which the program is changed before it replayed in order to increase the information from its execution we implemented our replay method on concurrent java programs and we show that it consistently achieves close replay in presence of incomplete information and incomplete control as well as when the program is changed before it is replayed
the work in this paper is motivated by the real world problems such as mining frequent traversal path patterns from very large web logs generalized suffix trees over very large alphabet can be used to solve such problems however traditional algorithms such as the weiner ukkonen and mccreight algorithms are not sufficient assurance of practicality because of large magnitudes of the alphabet and the set of strings in those real world problems two new algorithms are designed for fast construction of generalized suffix trees over very large alphabet and their performance is analyzed in comparison with the well known ukkonen algorithm it is shown that these two algorithms have better performance and can deal with large alphabets and large string sets well

we present the design and implementation of new garbage collection framework that significantly generalizes existing copying collectors the beltway framework exploits and separates object age and incrementality it groups objects in one or more increments on queues called belts collects belts independently and collects increments on belt in first in first out order we show that beltway configurations selected by command line options act and perform the same as semi space generational and older first collectors and encompass all previous copying collectors of which we are aware the increasing reliance on garbage collected languages such as java requires that the collector perform well we show that the generality of beltway enables us to design and implement new collectors that are robust to variations in heap size and improve total execution time over the best generational copying collectors of which we are aware by up to and on average by to for small to moderate heap sizes new garbage collection algorithms are rare and yet we define not just one but new family of collectors that subsumes previous work this generality enables us to explore larger design space and build better collectors

data mining mechanisms have widely been applied in various businesses and manufacturing companies across many industry sectors sharing data or sharing mined rules has become trend among business partnerships as it is perceived to be mutually benefit way of increasing productivity for all parties involved nevertheless this has also increased the risk of unexpected information leaks when releasing data to conceal restrictive itemsets patterns contained in the source database sanitization process transforms the source database into released database that the counterpart cannot extract sensitive rules from the transformed result also conceals non restrictive information as an unwanted event called side effect or the misses cost the problem of finding an optimal sanitization method which conceals all restrictive itemsets but minimizes the misses cost is np hard to address this challenging problem this study proposes the maximum item conflict first micf algorithm experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective has low sanitization rate and can generally achieve significantly lower misses cost than those achieved by the minfia maxfia iga and algob methods in several real and artificial datasets
networked games can provide groupware developers with important lessons in how to deal with real world networking issues such as latency limited bandwidth and packet loss games have similar demands and characteristics to groupware but unlike the applications studied by academics games have provided production quality real time interaction for many years the techniques used by games have not traditionally been made public but several game networking libraries have recently been released as open source providing the opportunity to learn how games achieve network performance we examined five game libraries to find networking techniques that could benefit groupware this paper presents the concepts most valuable to groupware developers including techniques to deal with limited bandwidth reliability and latency some of the techniques have been previously reported in the networking literature therefore the contribution of this paper is to survey which techniques have been shown to work over several years and then to link these techniques to quality requirements specific to groupware by adopting these techniques groupware designers can dramatically improve network performance on the real world internet

search engines need to evaluate queries extremely fast challenging task given the quantities of data being indexed significant proportion of the queries posed to search engines involve phrases in this article we consider how phrase queries can be efficiently supported with low disk overheads our previous research has shown that phrase queries can be rapidly evaluated using nextword indexes but these indexes are twice as large as conventional inverted files alternatively special purpose phrase indexes can be used but it is not feasible to index all phrases we propose combinations of nextword indexes and phrase indexes with inverted files as solution to this problem our experiments show that combined use of partial nextword partial phrase and conventional inverted index allows evaluation of phrase queries in quarter the time required to evaluate such queries with an inverted file alone the additional space overhead is only percnt of the size of the inverted file
the concept of privacy preserving has recently been proposed in response to the concerns of preserving personal or sensible information derived from data mining algorithms for example through data mining sensible information such as private information or patterns may be inferred from non sensible information or unclassified data there have been two types of privacy concerning data mining output privacy tries to hide the mining results by minimally altering the data input privacy tries to manipulate the data so that the mining result is not affected or minimally affectedfor output privacy in hiding association rules current approaches require hidden rules or patterns to be given in advance this selection of rules would require data mining process to be executed first based on the discovered rules and privacy requirements hidden rules or patterns are then selected manually however for some applications we are interested in hiding certain constrained classes of association rules such as collaborative recommendation association rules to hide such rules the pre process of finding these hidden rules can be integrated into the hiding process as long as the recommended items are given in this work we propose two algorithms dcis decrease confidence by increase support and dcds decrease confidence by decrease support to automatically hiding collaborative recommendation association rules without pre mining and selection of hidden rules examples illustrating the proposed algorithms are given numerical simulations are performed to show the various effects of the algorithms recommendations of appropriate usage of the proposed algorithms based on the characteristics of databases are reported
in recent years peer to peer pp file sharing systems have evolved to accommodate growing numbers of participating peers in particular new features have changed the properties of the unstructured overlay topologies formed by these peers little is known about the characteristics of these topologies and their dynamics in modern file sharing applications despite their importance this paper presents detailed characterization of pp overlay topologies and their dynamics focusing on the modern gnutella network we present cruiser fast and accurate pp crawler which can capture complete snapshot of the gnutella network of more than one million peers in just few minutes and show how inaccuracy in snapshots can lead to erroneous conclusions such as power law degree distribution leveraging recent overlay snapshots captured with cruiser we characterize the graph related properties of individual overlay snapshots and overlay dynamics across slices of back to back snapshots our results reveal that while the gnutella network has dramatically grown and changed in many ways it still exhibits the clustering and short path lengths of small world network furthermore its overlay topology is highly resilient to random peer departure and even systematic attacks more interestingly overlay dynamics lead to an onion like biased connectivity among peers where each peer is more likely connected to peers with higher uptime therefore long lived peers form stable core that ensures reachability among peers despite overlay dynamics

algorithmic solutions can help reduce energy consumption in computing environs
collaborative filtering has become an established method to measure users similarity and to make predictions about their interests however prediction accuracy comes at the cost of user's privacy in order to derive accurate similarity measures users are required to share their rating history with each other in this work we propose new measure of similarity which achieves comparable prediction accuracy to the pearson correlation coefficient and that can successfully be estimated without breaking users privacy this novel method works by estimating the number of concordant discordant and tied pairs of ratings between two users with respect to shared random set of ratings in doing so neither the items rated nor the ratings themselves are disclosed thus achieving strictly private collaborative filtering the technique has been evaluated using the recently released netflix prize dataset
this article introduces novel representation for three dimensional objects in terms of local affine invariant descriptors of their images and the spatial relationships between the corresponding surface patches geometric constraints associated with different views of the same patches under affine projection are combined with normalized representation of their appearance to guide matching and reconstruction allowing the acquisition of true affine and euclidean models from multiple unregistered images as well as their recognition in photographs taken from arbitrary viewpoints the proposed approach does not require separate segmentation stage and it is applicable to highly cluttered scenes modeling and recognition results are presented
we study an approach to text categorization that combines distributional clustering of words and support vector machine svm classifier this word cluster representation is computed using the recently introduced information bottleneck method which generates compact and efficient representation of documents when combined with the classification power of the svm this method yields high performance in text categorization this novel combination of svm with word cluster representation is compared with svm based categorization using the simpler bag of words bow representation the comparison is performed over three known datasets on one of these datasets the newsgroups the method based on word clusters significantly outperforms the word based representation in terms of categorization accuracy or representation efficiency on the two other sets reuters and webkb the word based representation slightly outperforms the word cluster representation we investigate the potential reasons for this behavior and relate it to structural differences between the datasets
we consider the problem of finding highly correlated pairs in large data set that is given threshold not too small we wish to report all the pairs of items or binary attributes whose pearson correlation coefficients are greater than the threshold correlation analysis is an important step in many statistical and knowledge discovery tasks normally the number of highly correlated pairs is quite small compared to the total number of pairs identifying highly correlated pairs in naive way by computing the correlation coefficients for all the pairs is wasteful with massive data sets where the total number of pairs may exceed the main memory capacity the computational cost of the naive method is prohibitive in their kdd paper hui xiong et al address this problem by proposing the taper algorithm the algorithm goes through the data set in two passes it uses the first pass to generate set of candidate pairs whose correlation coefficients are then computed directly in the second pass the efficiency of the algorithm depends greatly on the selectivity pruning power of its candidate generating stagein this work we adopt the general framework of the taper algorithm but propose different candidate generation method for pair of items taper's candidate generation method considers only the frequencies supports of individual items our method also considers the frequency support of the pair but does not explicitly count this frequency support we give simple randomized algorithm whose false negative probability is negligible the space and time complexities of generating the candidate set in our algorithm are asymptotically the same as taper's we conduct experiments on synthesized and real data the results show that our algorithm produces greatly reduced candidate set one that can be several orders of magnitude smaller than that generated by taper because of this our algorithm uses much less memory and can be faster the former is critical for dealing with massive data
this study uses neural field model to investigate computational aspects of population coding and decoding when the stimulus is single variable general prototype model for the encoding process is proposed in which neural responses are correlated with strength specified by gaussian function of their difference in preferred stimuli based on the model we study the effect of correlation on the fisher information compare the performances of three decoding methods that differ in the amount of encoding information being used and investigate the implementation of the three methods by using recurrent network this study not only rediscovers main results in existing literatures in unified way but also reveals important new features especially when the neural correlation is strong as the neural correlation of firing becomes larger the fisher information decreases drastically we confirm that as the width of correlation increases the fisher information saturates and no longer increases in proportion to the number of neurons however we prove that as the width increases further wider than times the effective width of the turning function the fisher information increases again and it increases without limit in proportion to the number of neurons furthermore we clarify the asymptotic efficiency of the maximum likelihood inference mli type of decoding methods for correlated neural signals it shows that when the correlation covers nonlocal range of population excepting the uniform correlation and when the noise is extremely small the mli type of method whose decoding error satisfies the cauchy type distribution is not asymptotically efficient this implies that the variance is no longer adequate to measure decoding accuracy
recently there has been growing interest in gossip based protocols that employ randomized communication to ensure robust information dissemination in this paper we present novel gossip based scheme using which all the nodes in an node overlay network can compute the common aggregates of min max sum average and rank of their values using log log messages within log log log rounds of communication to the best of our knowledge ours is the first result that shows how to compute these aggregates with high probability using only log log messages in contrast the best known gossip based algorithm for computing these aggregates requires nlog messages and log rounds thus our algorithm allows system designers to trade off small increase in round complexity with significant reduction in message complexity this can lead to dramatically lower network congestion and longer node lifetimes in wireless and sensor networks where channel bandwidth and battery life are severely constrained
partitioning an application among software running on microprocessor and hardware co processors in on chip configurable logic has been shown to improve performance and energy consumption in embedded systems meanwhile dynamic software optimization methods have shown the usefulness and feasibility of runtime program optimization but those optimizations do not achieve as much as partitioning we introduce first approach to dynamic hardware software partitioning we describe our system architecture and initial on chip tools including profiler decompiler synthesis and placement and routing tools for simplified configurable logic fabric able to perform dynamic partitioning of real benchmarks we show speedups averaging for five benchmarks taken from powerstone netbench and our own benchmarks
developing desirable framework for handling inconsistencies in software requirements specifications is challenging problem it has been widely recognized that the relative priority of requirements can help developers to make some necessary trade off decisions for resolving con flicts however for most distributed development such as viewpoints based approaches different stakeholders may assign different levels of priority to the same shared requirements statement from their own perspectives the disagreement in the local levels of priority assigned to the same shared requirements statement often puts developers into dilemma during the inconsistency handling process the main contribution of this paper is to present prioritized merging based framework for handling inconsistency in distributed software requirements specifications given set of distributed inconsistent requirements collections with the local prioritization we first construct requirements specification with prioritization from an overall perspective we provide two approaches to constructing requirements specification with the global prioritization including merging based construction and priority vector based construction following this we derive proposals for handling inconsistencies from the globally prioritized requirements specification in terms of prioritized merging moreover from the overall perspective these proposals may be viewed as the most appropriate to modifying the given inconsistent requirements specification in the sense of the ordering relation over all the consistent subsets of the requirements specification finally we consider applying negotiation based techniques to viewpoints so as to identify an acceptable common proposal from these proposals
even the best laid plans can fail and robot plans executed in real world domains tend to do so often the ability of robot to reliably monitor the execution of plans and detect failures is essential to its performance and its autonomy in this paper we propose technique to increase the reliability of monitoring symbolic robot plans we use semantic domain knowledge to derive implicit expectations of the execution of actions in the plan and then match these expectations against observations we present two realizations of this approach crisp one which assumes deterministic actions and reliable sensing and uses standard knowledge representation system loom and probabilistic one which takes into account uncertainty in action effects in sensing and in world states we perform an extensive validation of these realizations through experiments performed both in simulation and on real robots
database queries are often exploratory and users often find their queries return too many answers many of them irrelevant existing work either categorizes or ranks the results to help users locate interesting results the success of both approaches depends on the utilization of user preferences however most existing work assumes that all users have the same user preferences but in real life different users often have different preferences this paper proposes two step solution to address the diversity issue of user preferences for the categorization approach the proposed solution does not require explicit user involvement the first step analyzes query history of all users in the system offline and generates set of clusters over the data each corresponding to one type of user preferences when user asks query the second step presents to the user navigational tree over clusters generated in the first step such that the user can easily select the subset of clusters matching his needs the user then can browse rank or categorize the results in selected clusters the navigational tree is automatically constructed using cost based algorithm which considers the cost of visiting both intermediate nodes and leaf nodes in the tree an empirical study demonstrates the benefits of our approach
database applications often require to evaluate queries containing quantifiers or disjunctions eg for handling general integrity constraints existing efficient methods for processing quantifiers depart from the relational model as they rely on non algebraic procedures looking at quantified query evaluation from new angle we propose an approach to process quantifiers that makes use of relational algebra operators only our approach performs in two phases the first phase normalizes the queries producing canonical form this form permits to improve the translation into relational algebra performed during the second phase the improved translation relies on new operator the complement join that generalizes the set difference on algebraic expressions of universal quantifiers that avoid the expensive division operator in many cases and on special processing of disjunctions by means of constrained outer joins our method achieves an efficiency at least comparable with that of previous proposals better in most cases furthermore it is considerably simpler to implement as it completely relies on relational data structures and operators
peer to peer pp model being widely adopted in todays internet computing suffers from the problem of topology mismatch between the overlay networks and the underlying physical network traditional topology optimization techniques identify physical closer nodes to connect as overlay neighbors but could significantly shrink the search scope recent efforts have been made to address the mismatch problem without sacrificing search scope but they either need time synchronization among peers or have low convergent speed in this paper we propose scalable bipartite overlay sbo scheme to optimize the overlay topology by identifying and replacing the mismatched connections in sbo we employ an efficient strategy for distributing optimization tasks in peers with different colors we conducted comprehensive simulations to evaluate this design the results show that sbo achieves approximately reduction on traffic cost and about reduction on query response time our comparisons with previous approaches to address the topology mismatch problem have shown that sbo can achieve fast convergent speed without the need of time synchronization among peers

multiple clock domain mcd processor addresses the challenges of clock distribution and power dissipation by dividing chip into several coarse grained clock domains allowing frequency and voltage to be reduced in domains that are not currently on the application's critical path given reconfiguration mechanism capable of choosing appropriate times and values for voltage frequency scaling an mcd processor has the potential to achieve significant energy savings with low performance degradationearly work on mcd processors evaluated the potential for energy savings by manually inserting reconfiguration instructions into applications or by employing an oracle driven by off line analysis of identical prior program runs subsequent work developed hardware based on line mechanism that averages of the energy delay improvement achieved via off line analysisin this paper we consider the automatic insertion of reconfiguration instructions into applications using profile driven binary rewriting profile based reconfiguration introduces the need for training runs prior to production use of given application but avoids the hardware complexity of on line reconfiguration it also has the potential to yield significantly greater energy savings experimental results training on small data sets and then running on larger alternative data sets indicate that the profile driven approach is more stable than hardware based reconfiguration and yields virtually all of the energy delay improvement achieved via off line analysis
an accurate and rapid method is required to retrieve the overwhelming majority of digital images to date image retrieval methods include content based retrieval and keyword based retrieval the former utilizing visual features such as color and brightness and the latter utilizing keywords that describe the image however the effectiveness of these methods in providing the exact images the user wants has been under scrutiny hence many researchers have been working on relevance feedback process in which responses from the user are given as feedback during the retrieval session in order to define user's need and provide an improved result methods that employ relevance feedback however do have drawbacks because several pieces of feedback are necessary to produce an appropriate result and the feedback information cannot be reused in this paper novel retrieval model is proposed which annotates an image with keywords and modifies the confidence level of the keywords in response to the user's feedback in the proposed model not only the images that have been given feedback but also other images with visual features similar to the features used to distinguish the positive images are subjected to confidence modification this allows for modification of large number of images with relatively little feedback ultimately leading to faster and more accurate retrieval results an experiment was performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and the result demonstrated rapid increase in recall and precision using the same amount of feedback
we present framework for designing efficient distributed data structures for multi dimensional data our structures which we call skip webs extend and improve previous randomized distributed data structures including skipnets and skip graphs our framework applies to general class of data querying scenarios which include linear one dimensional data such as sorted sets as well as multi dimensional data such as dimensional octrees and digital tries of character strings defined over fixed alphabetwe show how to perform query over such set of items spread among hosts using log log log messages for one dimensional data or log messages for fixed dimensional data while using only log space per host we also show how to make such structures dynamic so as to allow for insertions and deletions in log messages for quadtrees octrees and digital tries and log log log messages for one dimensional data finally we show how to apply blocking strategy to skip webs to further improve message complexity for one dimensional data when hosts can store more data
by using elliptic curve cryptography ecc it has been recently shown that public key cryptography pkc is indeed feasible on resource constrained nodes this feasibility however does not necessarily mean attractiveness as the obtained results are still not satisfactory enough in this paper we present results on implementing ecc as well as the related emerging field of pairing based cryptography pbc on two of the most popular sensor nodes by doing that we show that pkc is not only viable but in fact attractive for wsns as far as we know pairing computations presented in this paper are the most efficient results on the mica bit mhz atmegal and tmote sky bit mhz msp nodes
animation techniques for controlling passive simulation are commonly based on an optimization paradigm the user provides goals priori and sophisticated numerical methods minimize cost function that represents these goals unfortunately for multibody systems with discontinuous contact events these optimization problems can be highly nontrivial to solve and many hour offline optimizations unintuitive parameters and convergence failures can frustrate end users and limit usage on the other hand users are quite adaptable and systems which provide interactive feedback via an intuitive interface can leverage the user's own abilities to quickly produce interesting animations however the online computation necessary for interactivity limits scene complexity in practice we introduce many worlds browsing method which circumvents these limits by exploiting the speed of multibody simulators to compute numerous example simulations in parallel offline and online and allow the user to browse and modify them interactively we demonstrate intuitive interfaces through which the user can select among the examples and interactively adjust those parts of the scene that do not match his requirements we show that using combination of our techniques unusual and interesting results can be generated for moderately sized scenes with under an hour of user time scalability is demonstrated by sampling much larger scenes using modest offline computations
current capacity planning practices based on heavy over provisioning of power infrastructure hurt the operational costs of data centers as well as ii the computational work they can support we explore combination of statistical multiplexing techniques to improve the utilization of the power hierarchy within data center at the highest level of the power hierarchy we employ controlled underprovisioning and over booking of power needs of hosted workloads at the lower levels we introduce the novel notion of soft fuses to flexibly distribute provisioned power among hosted workloads based on their needs our techniques are built upon measurement driven profiling and prediction framework to characterize key statistical properties of the power needs of hosted workloads and their aggregates we characterize the gains in terms of the amount of computational work cpu cycles per provisioned unit of power computation per provisioned watt cpw our technique is able to double the cpwoffered by power distribution unit pdu running the commerce benchmark tpc compared to conventional provisioning practices over booking the pdu by based on tails of power profiles yields further improvement of reactive techniques implemented on our xen vmm based servers dynamically modulate cpu dvfs states to ensure power draw below the limits imposed by soft fuses finally information captured in our profiles also provide ways of controlling application performance degradation despite overbooking the th percentile of tpc session response time only grew from sec to sec degradation of
resource aware random key predistribution schemes have been proposed to overcome the limitations of energy constrained wireless sensor networks wsns in most of these schemes each sensor node is loaded with key ring neighbouring nodes are considered to be connected through secure link if they share common key nodes which are not directly connected establish secure path which is then used to negotiate symmetric key however since different symmetric keys are used for different links along the secure path each intermediate node must first decrypt the message received from the upstream node notice that during this process the negotiated key is revealed to each node along the secure path the objective of this paper is to address this shortcoming to this end we propose an end to end pairwise key establishment scheme which uses properly selected set of node disjoint paths to securely negotiate symmetric keys between sensor nodes we show through analysis and simulation that our scheme is highly secure against node captures in wsns
silicon technology advances have made it possible to pack millions of transistors switching at high clock speeds on single chip while these advances bring unprecedented performance to electronic products they also pose difficult power energy consumption problems for example large number of transistors in dense on chip cache memories consume significant static leakage power even if the cache is not used by the current computation while previous compiler research studied code and data restructuring for improving data cache performance to our knowledge there exists no compiler based study that targets data cache leakage power consumption in this paper we present code restructuring techniques for array based and pointer intensive applications for reducing data cache leakage energy consumption the idea is to let the compiler analyze the application code and insert instructions that turn off cache lines that keep variables not used by the current computation this turning off does not destroy contents of cache line and waking up the cache line when it is accessed later does not incur much overhead due to inherent data locality in applications we find that at given time only small portion of the data cache needs to be active the remaining part can be placed into leakage saving mode state ie they can be turned off our experimental results indicate that the proposed compiler based strategy reduces the cache energy consumption significantly we also demonstrate how different compiler optimizations can increase the effectiveness of our strategy
modern source control systems such as subversion preserve change sets of files as atomic commits however the specific ordering information in which files were changed is typically not found in these source code repositories in this paper set of heuristics for grouping change sets ie log entries found in source code repositories is presented given such groups of change sets sequences of files that frequently change together are uncovered this approach not only gives the unordered sets of files but supplements them with partial temporal ordering information the technique is demonstrated on subset of kde source code repository the results show that the approach is able to find sequences of changed files
it is crucial to maximize targeting efficiency and customer satisfaction in personalized marketing state of the art techniques for targeting focus on the optimization of individual campaigns our motivation is the belief that the effectiveness of campaign with respect to customer is affected by how many precedent campaigns have been recently delivered to the customer we raise the multiple recommendation problem which occurs when performing several personalized campaigns simultaneously we formulate the multicampaign assignment problem to solve this issue and propose algorithms for the problem the algorithms include dynamic programming and efficient heuristic methods we verify by experiments the effectiveness of the problem formulation and the proposed algorithms
given an incorrect value produced during failed program run eg wrong output value or value that causes the program to crash the backward dynamic slice of the value very frequently captures the faulty code responsible for producing the incorrect value although the dynamic slice often contains only small percentage of the statements executed during the failed program run the dynamic slice can still be large and thus considerable effort may be required by the programmer to locate the faulty codein this paper we develop strategy for pruning the dynamic slice to identify subset of statements in the dynamic slice that are likely responsible for producing the incorrect value we observe that some of the statements used in computing the incorrect value may also have been involved in computing correct values eg value produced by statement in the dynamic slice of the incorrect value may also have been used in computing correct output value prior to the incorrect value for each such executed statement in the dynamic slice using the value profiles of the executed statements we compute confidence value ranging from to higher confidence value corresponds to greater likelihood that the execution of the statement produced correct value given failed run involving execution of single error we demonstrate that the pruning of dynamic slice by excluding only the statements with the confidence value of is highly effective in reducing the size of the dynamic slice while retaining the faulty code in the slice our experiments show that the number of distinct statements in pruned dynamic slice are to times less than the full dynamic slice confidence values also prioritize the statements in the dynamic slice according to the likelihood of them being faulty we show that examining the statements in the order of increasing confidence values is an effective strategy for reducing the effort of fault location
dynamic inference techniques have been demonstrated to provide useful support for various software engineering tasks including bug finding test suite evaluation and improvement and specification generation to date however dynamic inference has only been used effectively on small programs under controlled conditions in this paper we identify reasons why scaling dynamic inference techniques has proven difficult and introduce solutions that enable dynamic inference technique to scale to large programs and work effectively with the imperfect traces typically available in industrial scenarios we describe our approximate inference algorithm present and evaluate heuristics for winnowing the large number of inferred properties to manageable set of interesting properties and report on experiments using inferred properties we evaluate our techniques on jboss and the windows kernel our tool is able to infer many of the properties checked by the static driver verifier and leads us to discover previously unknown bug in windows
the last fifteen years has seen vast proliferation of middleboxes to solve all manner of persistent limitations in the internet protocol suite examples include firewalls nats load balancers traffic shapers deep packet intrusion detection virtual private networks network monitors transparent web caches content delivery networks and the list goes on and on however most smaller networks in homes small businesses and the developing world are left without this level of support further the management burden and limitations of middleboxes are apparent even in enterprise networks we argue for shift from using proprietary middle box harware as the dominant tool for managing networks toward using open software running on end hosts we show that functionality that seemingly must be in the network such as nats and traffic prioritization can be more cheaply flexibly and securely provided by distributed software running on end hosts working in concert with vastly simplified physical network hardware
set valued ordered information systems can be classified into two categories disjunctive and conjunctive systems through introducing two new dominance relations to set valued information systems we first introduce the conjunctive disjunctive set valued ordered information systems and develop an approach to queuing problems for objects in presence of multiple attributes and criteria then we present dominance based rough set approach for these two types of set valued ordered information systems which is mainly based on substitution of the indiscernibility relation by dominance relation through the lower upper approximation of decision some certain possible decision rules from so called set valued ordered decision table can be extracted finally we present attribute reduction also called criteria reduction in ordered information systems approaches to these two types of ordered information systems and ordered decision tables which can be used to simplify set valued ordered information system and find decision rules directly from set valued ordered decision table these criteria reduction approaches can eliminate those criteria that are not essential from the viewpoint of the ordering of objects or decision rules
nowadays embedded systems are growing at an impressive rate and provide more and more sophisticated applications characterized by having complex array index manipulation and large number of data accesses those applications require high performance specific computation that general purpose processors can not deliver at reasonable energy consumption very long instruction word architectures seem good solution providing enough computational performance at low power with the required programmability to speed up the time to market those architectures rely on compiler effort to exploit the available instruction and data parallelism to keep the data path busy all the time with the density of transistors doubling each months more and more sophisticated architectures with high number of computational resources running in parallel are emerging with this increasing parallel computation the access to data is becoming the main bottleneck that limits the available parallelism to alleviate this problem in current embedded architectures special unit works in parallel with the main computing elements to ensure efficient feed and storage of the data the address generator unit which comes in many flavors future architectures will have to deal with enormous memory bandwidth in distributed memories and the development of address generators units will be crucial for effective next generation of embedded processors where global trade offs between reaction time bandwidth energy and area must be achieved this paper provides survey of methods and techniques that optimize the address generation process for embedded systems explaining current research trends and needs for future

in this paper we consider the problem of web page usage prediction in web site by modeling users navigation history with weighted suffix trees this user's navigation prediction can be exploited either in an on line recommendation system in website or in web page cache system the method proposed has the advantage that it demands constant amount of computational effort per user action and consumes relatively small amount of extra memory space these features make the method ideal for an on line working environment finally we have performed an evaluation of the proposed scheme with experiments on various website logfiles and we have found that its prediction quality is fairly good in many cases outperforming existing solutions

internet routing is mostly based on static information it's dynamicity is limited to reacting to changes in topology adaptive performance based routing decisions would not only improve the performance itself of the internet but also its security and availability however previous approaches for making internet routing adaptive based on optimizing network wide objectives are not suited for an environment in which autonomous and possibly malicious entities interact in this paper we propose different framework for adaptive routing decisions based on regret minimizing online learning algorithms these algorithms as applied to routing are appealing because adopters can independently improve their own performance while being robust to adversarial behavior however in contrast to approaches based on optimization theory that provide guarantees from the outset about network wide behavior the network wide behavior if online learning algorithms were to interact with each other is less understood in this paper we study this interaction in realistic internet environment and find that the outcome is stable state and that the optimality gap with respect to the network wide optimum is small our findings suggest that online learning may be suitable framework for adaptive routing decisions in the internet
real time embedded systems are typically constrained in terms of three system performance criteria space time and energy the performance requirements are directly translated into constraints imposed on the system's resources such as code size execution time and energy consumption these resource constraints often interact or even conflict with each other in complex manner making it difficult for system developer to apply well defined design methodology in developing real time embedded system motivated by this observation we propose design framework that can flexibly balance the tradeoff involving the system's code size execution time and energy consumption given system specification and an optimization criteria the proposed technique generates set of design parameters in such way that system cost function is minimized while the given resource constraints are satisfied specifically the technique derives code generation decision for each task so that specific version of code is selected among number of different ones that have distinct characteristics in terms of code size and execution time in addition the design framework determines the voltage frequency setting for variable voltage processor whose supply voltage can be adjusted at runtime in order to minimize the energy consumption while execution performance is degraded accordingly the proposed technique formulates this design process as constrained optimization problem we show that this optimization problem is np hard and then provide heuristic solution to it we show that these seemingly conflicting design goals can be pursued by using simple optimization algorithm that works with single optimization criteria moreover the optimization is driven by an abstract system specification given by the system developer so that the system development process can be automated the results from our simulation show that the proposed algorithm finds solution that is close to the optimal one with the average error smaller than percent
the goal of the research described here is to develop multistrategy classifier system that can be used for document categorization the system automatically discovers classification patterns by applying several empirical learning methods to different representations for preclassified documents belonging to an imbalanced sample the learners work in parallel manner where each learner carries out its own feature selection based on evolutionary techniques and then obtains classification model in classifying documents the system combines the predictions of the learners by applying evolutionary techniques as well the system relies on modular flexible architecture that makes no assumptions about the design of learners or the number of learners available and guarantees the independence of the thematic domain
we show that for several natural classes of structured matrices including symmetric circulant hankel and toeplitz matrices approximating the permanent modulo prime is as hard as computing its exact value results of this kind are well known for arbitrary matrices however the techniques used do not seem to apply to structured matrices our approach is based on recent advances in the hidden number problem introduced by boneh and venkatesan in combined with some bounds of exponential sums motivated by the waring problem in finite fields
nowadays it is widely accepted that the data warehouse design task should be largely automated furthermore the data warehouse conceptual schema must be structured according to the multidimensional model and as consequence the most common way to automatically look for subjects and dimensions of analysis is by discovering functional dependencies as dimensions functionally depend on the fact over the data sources most advanced methods for automating the design of the data warehouse carry out this process from relational oltp systems assuming that rdbms is the most common kind of data source we may find and taking as starting point relational schema in contrast in our approach we propose to rely instead on conceptual representation of the domain of interest formalized through domain ontology expressed in the dl lite description logic we propose an algorithm to discover functional dependencies from the domain ontology that exploits the inference capabilities of dl lite thus fully taking into account the semantics of the domain we also provide an evaluation of our approach in real world scenario
while set associative caches incur fewer misses than direct mapped caches they typically have slower hit times and higher power consumption when multiple tag and data banks are probed in parallel this paper presents the location cache structure which significantly reduces the power consumption for large set associative caches we propose to use small cache called location cache to store the location of future cache references if there is hit in the location cache the supported cache is accessed as direct mapped cache otherwise the supported cache is referenced as conventional set associative cachethe worst case access latency of the location cache system is the same as that of conventional cache the location cache is virtually indexed so that operations on it can be performed in parallel with the tlb address translation these advantages make it ideal for cache systems where traditional way predication strategies perform poorlywe used the cacti cache model to evaluate the power con sumption and access latency of proposed cache architecture simplescalar cpu simulator was used to produce final results it is shown that the proposed location cache architecture is power efficient in the simulated cache configurations up to of cache accessing energy and of average cache access latency can be reduced
middleware is often built using layered architectural style layered design provides good separation of the different concerns of middleware such as communication marshaling request dispatching thread management etc layered architecture helps in the development and evolution of the middleware it also provides tactical side benefits layers provide convenient protection boundaries for enforcing security policies however the benefits of this layered structure come at cost layered designs can hinder performance related optimizations and actually make it more difficult to adapt systems to conveniently address late bound requirements such as dependability access control virus protection and so on we present some examples of this issue and outline new approach under investigation at uc davis which includes ideas in middleware architectures and programming models
symmetric multiprocessor smp servers provide superior performance for the commercial workloads that dominate the internet our simulation results show that over one third of cache misses by these applications result in cache to cache transfers where the data is found in another processor's cache rather than in memory smps are optimized for this case by using snooping protocols that broadcast address transactions to all processors conversely directory based shared memory systems must indirectly locate the owner and sharers through directory resulting in larger average miss latenciesthis paper proposes timestamp snooping technique that allows smps to utilize high speed switched interconnection networks and ii exploit physical locality by delivering address transactions to processors and memories without regard to order traditional snooping requires physical ordering of transactions timestamp snooping works by processing address transactions in logical order logical time is maintained by adding few bits per address transaction and having network switches perform handshake to ensure on time delivery processors and memories then reorder transactions based on their timestamps to establish total orderwe evaluate timestamp snooping with commercial workloads on processor sparc system using the simics full system simulator we simulate both an indirect butterfly and direct torus network design for oltp dss web serving web searching and one scientific application timestamp snooping with the butterfly network runs faster than directories at cost of more link traffic similarly with the torus network timestamp snooping runs faster for more link traffic thus timestamp snooping is worth considering when buying more interconnect bandwidth is easier than reducing interconnect latency

probabilistic top ranking queries have been extensively studied due to the fact that data obtained can be uncertain in many real applications probabilistic top ranking query ranks objects by the interplay of score and probability with an implicit assumption that both scores based on which objects are ranked and probabilities of the existence of the objects are stored in the same relation we observe that in general scores and probabilities are highly possible to be stored in different relations for example in column oriented dbmss and in data warehouses in this paper we study probabilistic top ranking queries when scores and probabilities are stored in different relations we focus on reducing the join cost in probabilistic top ranking we investigate two probabilistic score functions discuss the upper lower bounds in random access and sequential access and provide insights on the advantages and disadvantages of random sequential access in terms of upper lower bounds we also propose random sequential and hybrid algorithms to conduct probabilistic top ranking we conducted extensive performance studies using real and synthetic datasets and report our findings in this paper
we describe polynomial time algorithm for global value numbering which is the problem of discovering equivalences among program sub expressions we treat all conditionals as non deterministic and all program operators as uninterpreted we show that there are programs for which the set of all equivalences contains terms whose value graph representation requires exponential size our algorithm discovers all equivalences among terms of size at most in time that grows linearly with for global value numbering it suffices to choose to be the size of the program earlier deterministic algorithms for the same problem are either incomplete or take exponential time we provide detailed analytical comparison of some of these algorithms
level one cache normally resides on processor's critical path which determines the clock frequency directmapped caches exhibit fast access time but poor hit rates compared with same sized set associative caches due to nonuniform accesses to the cache sets which generate more conflict misses in some sets while other sets are underutilized we propose technique to reduce the miss rate of direct mapped caches through balancing the accesses to cache sets we increase the decoder length and thus reduce the accesses to heavily used sets without dynamically detecting the cache set usage information we introduce replacement policy to direct mapped cache design and increase the access to the underutilized cache sets with the help of programmable decoders on average the proposed balanced cache or bcache achieves and miss rate reductions on all speck benchmarks for the instruction and data caches respectively this translates into an average ipc improvement of the cache consumes more power per access but exhibits total memory access related energy saving due to the miss rate reductions and hence the reduction to applications execution time compared with previous techniques that aim at reducing the miss rate of direct mapped caches our technique requires only one cycle to access all cache hits and has the same access time of direct mapped cache
the problem of results merging in distributed information retrieval environments has been approached by two different directions in research estimation approaches attempt to calculate the relevance of the returned documents through ad hoc methodologies weighted score merging regression etc while download approaches download all the documents locally partially or completely in order to estimate first hand their relevance both have their advantages and disadvantages it is assumed that download algorithms are more effective but they are very expensive in terms of time and bandwidth estimation approaches on the other hand usually rely on document relevance scores being returned by the remote collections in order to achieve maximum performance in addition to that regression algorithms which have proved to be more effective than weighted scores merging rely on significant number of overlap documents in order to function effectively practically requiring multiple interactions with the remote collections the new algorithm that is introduced reconciles the above two approaches combining their strengths while minimizing their weaknesses it is based on downloading limited selected number of documents from the remote collections and estimating the relevance of the rest through regression methodologies the proposed algorithm is tested in variety of settings and its performance is found to be better than estimation approaches while approximating that of download
it is well known that grid technology has the ability to coordinate shared resources and scheduled tasks however the problem of resource management and task scheduling has always been one of the main challenges in this paper we present performance effective pre scheduling strategy for dispatching tasks onto heterogeneous processors the main extension of this study is the consideration of heterogeneous communication overheads in grid systems one significant improvement of our approach is that average turnaround time could be minimized by selecting the processor that has the smallest communication ratio first the other advantage of the proposed method is that system throughput can be increased by dispersing processor idle time our proposed technique can be applied on heterogeneous cluster systems as well as computational grid environments in which the communication costs vary in different clusters to evaluate performance of the proposed techniques we have implemented the proposed algorithms along with previous methods the experimental results show that our techniques outperform other algorithms in terms of lower average turnaround time higher average throughput less processor idle time and higher processors utilization
recent years have witnessed large body of research work on mining concept drifting data streams where primary assumption is that the up to date data chunk and the yet to come data chunk share identical distributions so classifiers with good performance on the up to date chunk would also have good prediction accuracy on the yet to come data chunk this stationary assumption however does not capture the concept drifting reality in data streams more recently learnable assumption has been proposed and allows the distribution of each data chunk to evolve randomly although this assumption is capable of describing the concept drifting in data streams it is still inadequate to represent real world data streams which usually suffer from noisy data as well as the drifting concepts in this paper we propose realistic assumption which asserts that the difficulties of mining data streams are mainly caused by both concept drifting and noisy data chunks consequently we present new aggregate ensemble ae framework which trains base classifiers using different learning algorithms on different data chunks all the base classifiers are then combined to form classifier ensemble through model averaging experimental results on synthetic and real world data show that ae is superior to other ensemble methods under our new realistic assumption for noisy data streams
it is becoming apparent that the next generation ip route lookup architecture needs to achieve speeds of gbps and beyond while supporting both ipv and ipv with fast real time updates to accommodate ever growing routing tables some of the proposed multibit trie based schemes such as tree bitmap have been used in today's high end routers however their large data structure often requires multiple external memory accesses for each route lookup pipelining technique is widely used to achieve high speed lookup with cost of using many external memory chips pipelining also often leads to poor memory load balancing in this paper we propose new ip route lookup architecture called flashtrie that overcomes the shortcomings of the multibit trie based approach we use hash based membership query to limit off chip memory accesses per lookup to one and to balance memory utilization among the memory modules we also develop new data structure called prefix compressed trie that reduces the size of bitmap by more than our simulation and implementation results show that flashtrie can achieve gbps worst case throughput while simultaneously supporting prefixes for ipv and prefixes for ipv using one fpga chip and four ddr sdram chips flashtrie also supports incremental real time updates

the advent of strong multi level partitioners has made topdown min cut placers favored choice for modern placer implementations we examine terminal propagation an important step in min cut placers because it is responsible for translating partitioning results into global placement wirelength assumptions in this work we identify previously overlooked problem ambiguous terminal propagation and propose solution based on the concept of feedback from automatic control systems implementing our approach in capo version and applying it to standard benchmark circuits yields up to wirelength reductions for the ibm benchmarks and reductions for peko instances experiments also show consistent improvements for routed wirelength yielding up to wirelength reductions with practical increase in placement runtime in addition our method significantly improves routability without building congestion maps and reduces the number of vias
efficient fine grain synchronization is extremely important to effectively harness the computational power of many core architectures however designing and implementing finegrain synchronization in such architectures presents several challenges including issues of synchronization induced overhead storage cost scalability and the level of granularity to which synchronization is applicable this paper proposes the synchronization state buffer ssb scalable architectural design for fine grain synchronization that efficiently performs synchronizations between concurrent threads the design of ssb is motivated by the following observation at any instance during the parallel execution only small fraction of memory locations are actively participating in synchronization based on this observation we present fine grain synchronization design that records and manages the states of frequently synchronized data using modest hardware support we have implemented the ssb design in the context of the core ibm cyclops architecture using detailed simulation we present our experience for set of benchmarks with different workload characteristics
pattern matching in concrete syntax is very useful in program manipulation tools in particular user defined extensions to such tools are written much easier using concrete syntax patterns few advanced frameworks for language development implement support for concrete syntax patterns but mainstream frameworks used today still do not support them this prevents most existing program manipulation tools from using concrete syntax matching which in particular severely limits the writing of tool extensions to few language experts this paper argues that the major implementation obstacle to the pervasive use of concrete syntax patterns is the pattern parser we propose an alternative approach based on unparsed patterns which are concrete syntax patterns that can be efficiently matched without being parsed this lighter approach gives up static checks that parsed patterns usually do in turn it can be integrated within any existing parser based software tool almost for free one possible consequence is enabling widespread adoption of extensible program manipulation tools by the majority of programmers unparsed patterns can be used in any programing language including multi lingual environments to demonstrate our approach we implemented it both as minimal patch for the gcc compiler allowing to scan source code for user defined patterns and as stand alone prototype called matchbox
depth of field refers to the swath through scene that is imaged in acceptable focus through an optics system such as camera lens control over depth of field is an important artistic tool that can be used to emphasize the subject of photograph in real camera the control over depth of field is limited by the nature of the image formation process and by physical constraints the depth of field effect has been simulated in computer graphics but with the same limited control as found in real camera lenses in this paper we use diffusion in non homogeneous medium to generalize depth of field in computer graphics by enabling the user to independently specify the degree of blur at each point in three dimensional space generalized depth of field provides novel tool to emphasize an area of interest within scene to pick objects out of crowd and to render busy complex picture more understandable by focusing only on relevant details that may be scattered throughout the scene our algorithm operates by blurring sequence of nonplanar layers that form the scene choosing suitable blur algorithm for the layers is critical thus we develop appropriate blur semantics such that the blur algorithm will properly generalize depth of field we found that diffusion in non homogeneous medium is the process that best suits these semantics
this paper introduces the expander new object oriented oo programming language construct designed to support object adaptation expanders allow existing classes to be noninvasively updated with new methods fields and superinterfaces each client can customize its view of class by explicitly importing any number of expanders this view then applies to all instances of that class including objects passed to the client from other components form of expander overriding allows expanders to interact naturally with oo style inheritancewe describe the design implementation and evaluation of ejava an extension to java supporting expanders we illustrate ejava's syntax and semantics through several examples the statically scoped nature of expander usage allows for modular static type system that prevents several important classes of errors we describe this modular static type system informally formalize ejava and its type system in an extension to featherweight java and prove type soundness theorem for the formalization we also describe modular compilation strategy for ejava which we have implemented using the polyglot extensible compiler framework finally we illustrate the practical benefits of ejava by using this compiler in two experiments
methods for triangle mesh decimation are common however most existing techniques operate only on static geometry in this paper we present view and pose independent method for the automatic simplification of skeletally articulated meshes such meshes have associated kinematic skeletons that are used to control their deformation with the position of each vertex influenced by linear combination of bone transformations our method extends the commonly used quadric error metric by incorporating knowledge of potential poses into probability function we minimize the average error of the deforming mesh over all possible configurations weighted by the probability this is possible by transforming the quadrics from each configuration into common coordinate system our simplification algorithm runs as preprocess and the resulting meshes can be seamlessly integrated into existing systems we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for generating highly simplified models while preserving necessary detail in deforming regions near joints
reliable broadband communication is becoming increasingly important during disaster recovery and emergency response operations in situations where infrastructure based communication is not available or has been disrupted an incident area network needs to be dynamically deployed ie temporary network that provides communication services for efficient crisis management at an incident site wireless mesh networks wmns are multi hop wireless networks with self healing and self configuring capabilities these features combined with the ability to provide wireless broadband connectivity at comparably low cost make wmns promising technology for incident management communications this paper specifically focuses on hybrid wmns which allow both mobile client devices as well as dedicated infrastructure nodes to form the network and provide routing and forwarding functionality hybrid wmns are the most generic and most flexible type of mesh networks and are ideally suited to meet the requirements of incident area communications however current wireless mesh and ad hoc routing protocols do not perform well in hybrid wmn and are not able to establish stable and high throughput communication paths one of the key reasons for this is their inability to exploit the typical high degree of heterogeneity in hybrid wmns safemesh the routing protocol presented in this paper addresses the limitations of current mesh and ad hoc routing protocols in the context of hybrid wmns safemesh is based on the well known aodv routing protocol and implements number of modifications and extensions that significantly improve its performance in hybrid wmns this is demonstrated via an extensive set of simulation results we further show the practicality of the protocol through prototype implementation and provide performance results obtained from small scale testbed deployment
topic modeling has been key problem for document analysis one of the canonical approaches for topic modeling is probabilistic latent semantic indexing which maximizes the joint probability of documents and terms in the corpus the major disadvantage of plsi is that it estimates the probability distribution of each document on the hidden topics independently and the number of parameters in the model grows linearly with the size of the corpus which leads to serious problems with overfitting latent dirichlet allocation lda is proposed to overcome this problem by treating the probability distribution of each document over topics as hidden random variable both of these two methods discover the hidden topics in the euclidean space however there is no convincing evidence that the document space is euclidean or flat therefore it is more natural and reasonable to assume that the document space is manifold either linear or nonlinear in this paper we consider the problem of topic modeling on intrinsic document manifold specifically we propose novel algorithm called laplacian probabilistic latent semantic indexing lapplsi for topic modeling lapplsi models the document space as submanifold embedded in the ambient space and directly performs the topic modeling on this document manifold in question we compare the proposed lapplsi approach with plsi and lda on three text data sets experimental results show that lapplsi provides better representation in the sense of semantic structure
the system and network architecture for static sensor nets is largely solved today with many stable commercial solutions now available and standardization efforts underway at the ieee ietf isa and within many industry groups as result many researchers have begun to explore new domains like mobile sensor networks or mobiscopes since they enable new applications in the home and office for health and safety and in transportation and asset management this paper argues that mobility invalidates many assumptions implicit in low power static designs so the architecture for micropower mobiscopes is still very much an open research question in this paper we explore several mobile sensing applications identify research challenges to their realization and explore how emerging technologies and real time motion data could help ease these challenges

structured peer to peer pp overlays have been successfully employed in many applications to locate content however they have been less effective in handling massive amounts of data because of the high overhead of maintaining indexes in this paper we propose pisces peer based system that indexes selected content for efficient search unlike traditional approaches that index all data pisces identifies subset of tuples to index based on some criteria such as query frequency update frequency index cost etc in addition coarse grained range index is built to facilitate the processing of queries that cannot be fully answered by the tuple level index more importantly pisces can adaptively self tune to optimize the subset of tuples to be indexed that is the partial index in pisces is built in just in time jit manner beneficial tuples for current users are pulled for indexing while indexed tuples with infrequent access and high maintenance cost are discarded we also introduce light weight monitoring scheme for structured networks to collect the necessary statistics we have conducted an extensive experimental study on planetlab to illustrate the feasibility practicality and efficiency of pisces the results show that pisces incurs lower maintenance cost and offers better search and query efficiency compared to existing methods
vast amount of valuable information produced and consumed by people and institutions is currently stored in relational databases for many purposes there is an ever increasing demand for having these databases published on the web so that users can query the data available in them an important requirement for this to happen is that query interfaces must be as simple and intuitive as possible in this paper we present labrador system for efficiently publishing relational databases on the web by using simple text box query interface the system operates by taking an unstructured keyword based query posed by user and automatically deriving an equivalent sql query that fits the user's information needs as expressed by the original query the sql query is then sent to dbms and its results are processed by labrador to create relevance based ranking of the answers experiments we present show that labrador can automatically find the most suitable sql query in more than of the cases and that the overhead introduced by the system in the overall query processing time is almost insignificant furthermore the system operates in non intrusive way since it requires no modifications to the target database schema
discriminative probabilistic models are very popular in nlp because of the latitude they afford in designing features but training involves complex trade offs among weights which can be dangerous few highly indicative features can swamp the contribution of many individually weaker features causing their weights to be undertrained such model is less robust for the highly indicative features may be noisy or missing in the test data to ameliorate this weight undertraining we introduce several new feature bagging methods in which separate models are trained on subsets of the original features and combined using mixture model or product of experts these methods include the logarithmic opinion pools used by smith et al we evaluate feature bagging on linear chain conditional random fields for two natural language tasks on both tasks the feature bagged crf performs better than simply training single crf on all the features
java programmers can document that the relationship between two objects is unchanging by declaring the field that encodes that relationship to be final this information can be used in program understanding and detection of errors in new code additions unfortunately few fields in programs are actually declared final programs often contain fields that could be final but are not declared so moreover the definition of final has restrictions on initializationthat limit its applicability we introduce stationary fields as generalization of final field in program is stationary if for every object that contains it all writes to the field occur before all the reads unlike the definition of final fields there can be multiple writes during initialization and initialization can span multiple methods we have developed an efficient algorithm for inferring which fields are stationary in program based on the observation that many fields acquire their value very close to object creation we presume that an object's initialization phase has concluded when its reference is saved in some heap object we perform precise analysis only regarding recently created objects applying our algorithm to real world java programs demonstrates that stationary fields are more common than final fields vs respectively in our benchmarks these surprising results have several significant implications first substantial portions of java programs appear to be written in functional style second initialization of these fields occurs very close to object creation when very good alias information is available these results open the door for more accurate and efficient pointer alias analysis
this article proposes statistical approach for fast articulated body tracking similar to the loose limbed model but using the factor graph representation and fast estimation algorithm fast nonparametric belief propagation on factor graphs is used to estimate the current marginal for each limb all belief propagation messages are represented as sums of weighted samples the resulting algorithm corresponds to set of particle filters one for each limb where an extra step recomputes the weight of each sample by taking into account the links between limbs applied to upper body tracking with stereo and colour images the resulting algorithm estimates the body pose in quasi real time hz results on sequences illustrate the effectiveness of this approach
we focus on collaborative filtering dealing with self organizing communities host mobility wireless access and ad hoc communications in such domain knowledge representation and users profiling can be hard remote servers can be often unreachable due to client mobility and feedback ratings collected during random connections to other users ad hoc devices can be useless because of natural differences between human beings our approach is based on so called affinity networks and on novel system called mobhinter that epidemically spreads recommendations through spontaneous similarities between users main results of our study are two fold firstly we show how to reach comparable recommendation accuracies in the mobile domain as well as in complete knowledge scenario secondly we propose epidemic collaborative strategies that can reduce rapidly and realistically the cold start problem

we present novel approach for classifying documents that combines different pieces of evidence eg textual features of documents links and citations transparently through data mining technique which generates rules associating these pieces of evidence to predefined classes these rules can contain any number and mixture of the available evidence and are associated with several quality criteria which can be used in conjunction to choose the best rule to be applied at classification time our method is able to perform evidence enhancement by link forwarding backwarding ie navigating among documents related through citation so that new pieces of link based evidence are derived when necessary furthermore instead of inducing single model or rule set that is good on average for all predictions the proposed approach employs lazy method which delays the inductive process until document is given for classification therefore taking advantage of better qualitative evidence coming from the document we conducted systematic evaluation of the proposed approach using documents from the acm digital library and from brazilian web directory our approach was able to outperform in both collections all classifiers based on the best available evidence in isolation as well as state of the art multi evidence classifiers we also evaluated our approach using the standard webkb collection where our approach showed gains of in accuracy being times faster further our approach is extremely efficient in terms of computational performance showing gains of more than one order of magnitude when compared against other multi evidence classifiers
distributed digital libraries dls integration is significant for the enforcement of novel searching mechanisms in the internet the great heterogeneity of systems storing and providing digital content requires the introduction of interoperability aspects in order to resolve integration problems in flexible and dynamic way our approach introduces an innovative service oriented pp system which initialises distributed ontology schema semantically describing and indexing the digital content stored in distributed dls the proposed architecture enforces the distributed semantic index by defining virtual clusters consisting of nodes peers with similar or related content in order to provide efficient searching and recommendation mechanisms furthermore use case example is presented in order to demonstrate the functionalities of the proposed architecture in pp network with dls containing cultural material
the maintenance of an existing database depends on the depth of understanding of its characteristics such an understanding is easily lost when the developers disperse the situation becomes worse when the related documentation is missing this paper addresses this issue by extracting the extended entity relationship schema from the relational schema we developed algorithms that investigate characteristics of an existing legacy database in order to identify candidate keys of all relations in the relational schema to locate foreign keys and to decide on the appropriate links between the given relations based on this analysis graph consistent with the entity relationship diagram is derived to contain all possible uniary and binary relationships between the given relations the minimum and maximum cardinalities of each link in the mentioned graph are determined and extra links within the graph are identified and categorized if any the latter information is necessary to optimize foreign keys related information finally the last steps in the process involve when applicable suggesting improvements on the original conceptual design deciding on relationships with attributes many to many and ary relationships and identifying is links user involvement in the process is minimized to the case of having multiple choices where the system does not have the semantic knowledge required to decide on certain choice
in this paper we propose new learning method for extracting bilingual word pairs from parallel corpora in various languages in cross language information retrieval the system must deal with various languages therefore automatic extraction of bilingual word pairs from parallel corpora with various languages is important however previous works based on statistical methods are insufficient because of the sparse data problem our learning method automatically acquires rules which are effective to solve the sparse data problem only from parallel corpora without any prior preparation of bilingual resource eg bilingual dictionary machine translation system we call this learning method inductive chain learning icl moreover the system using icl can extract bilingual word pairs even from bilingual sentence pairs for which the grammatical structures of the source language differ from the grammatical structures of the target language because the acquired rules have the information to cope with the different word orders of source language and target language in local parts of bilingual sentence pairs evaluation experiments demonstrated that the recalls of systems based on several statistical approaches were improved through the use of icl

we propose framework and methodology for quantifying the effect of denial of service dos attacks on distributed system we present systematic study of the resistance of gossip based multicast protocols to dos attacks we show that even distributed and randomized gossip based protocols which eliminate single points of failure do not necessarily eliminate vulnerabilities to dos attacks we propose drum simple gossip based multicast protocol that eliminates such vulnerabilities drum was implemented in java and tested on large cluster we show using closed form mathematical analysis simulations and empirical tests that drum survives severe dos attacks

volumetric displays which provide view of imagery illuminated in true space are promising platform for interactive applications however presenting text in volumetric displays can be challenge as the text may not be oriented towards the user this is especially problematic with multiple viewers as the text could for example appear forwards to one user and backwards to another in first experiment we determined the effects of rotations on text readability based on the results we developed and evaluated new technique which optimizes text orientation for multiple viewers this technique provided faster group reading times in collaborative experimental task
although data broadcast has been shown to be an efficient method for disseminating data items in mobile computing systems the issue on how to ensure consistency and currency of data items provided to mobile transactions mt which are generated by mobile clients has not been examined adequately while data items are being broadcast update transactions may install new values for them if the executions of update transactions and the broadcast of data items are interleaved without any control mobile transactions may observe inconsistent data values the problem will be more complex if the mobile clients maintain some cached data items for their mobile transactions in this paper we propose concurrency control method called ordered update first with order oufo for the mobile computing systems where mobile transaction consists of sequence of read operations and each mt is associated with time constraint on its completion time besides ensuring data consistency and maximizing currency of data to mobile transactions oufo also aims at reducing data access delay of mobile transactions using client caches hybrid re broadcast invalidation report ir mechanism is designed in oufo for checking the validity of cached data items so as to improve cache consistency and minimize the overhead of transaction restarts due to data conflicts this is highly important to the performance of the mobile computing systems where the mobile transactions are associated with deadline constraint on their completion times extensive simulation experiments have been performed to compare the performance of oufo with two other efficient schemes the multi version broadcast method and the periodic ir method the performance results show that oufo offers better performance in most aspects even when network disconnection is common
at present the search for specific information on the world wide web is faced with several problems which arise on the one hand from the vast number of information sources available and on the other hand from their intrinsic heterogeneity since standards are missing promising approach for solving the complex problems emerging in this context is the use of multi agent systems of information agents which cooperatively solve advanced information retrieval problems this requires advanced capabilities to address complex tasks such as search and assessment of information sources query planning information merging and fusion dealing with incomplete information and handling of inconsistency in this paper our interest lies in the role which some methods from the field of declarative logic programming can play in the realization of reasoning capabilities for information agents in particular we are interested to see how they can be used extended and further developed for the specific needs of this application domain we review some existing systems and current projects which typically address information integration problems we then focus on declarative knowledge representation methods and review and evaluate approaches and methods from logic programming and nonmonotonic reasoning for information agents we discuss advantages and drawbacks and point out the possible extensions and open issues
overall performance of the data mining process depends not just on the value of the induced knowledge but also on various costs of the process itself such as the cost of acquiring and pre processing training examples the cpu cost of model induction and the cost of committed errors recently several progressive sampling strategies for maximizing the overall data mining utility have been proposed all these strategies are based on repeated acquisitions of additional training examples until utility decrease is observed in this paper we present an alternative projective sampling strategy which fits functions to partial learning curve and partial run time curve obtained from small subset of potentially available data and then uses these projected functions to analytically estimate the optimal training set size the proposed approach is evaluated on variety of benchmark datasets using the rapidminer environment for machine learning and data mining processes the results show that the learning and run time curves projected from only several data points can lead to cheaper data mining process than the common progressive sampling methods
as most current query processing architectures are already pipelined it seems logical to apply them to data streams however two classes of query operators are impractical for processing long or infinite data streams unbounded stateful operators maintain state with no upper bound in size and so run out of memory blocking operators read an entire input before emitting single output and so might never produce result we believe that priori knowledge of data stream can permit the use of such operators in some cases we discuss kind of stream semantics called punctuated streams punctuations in stream mark the end of substreams allowing us to view an infinite stream as mixture of finite streams we introduce three kinds of invariants to specify the proper behavior of operators in the presence of punctuation pass invariants define when results can be passed on keep invariants define what must be kept in local state to continue successful operation propagation invariants define when punctuation can be passed on we report on our initial implementation and show strategy for proving implementations of these invariants are faithful to their relational counterparts
with the explosive growth of the world wide web the public is gaining access to massive amounts of information however locating needed and relevant information remains difficult task whether the information is textual or visual text search engines have existed for some years now and have achieved certain degree of success however despite the large number of images available on the web image search engines are still rare in this article we show that in order to allow people to profit from all this visual information there is need to develop tools that help them to locate the needed images with good precision in reasonable time and that such tools are useful for many applications and purposes the article surveys the main characteristics of the existing systems most often cited in the literature such as imagerover webseek diogenes and atlas wise it then examines the various issues related to the design and implementation of web image search engine such as data gathering and digestion indexing query specification retrieval and similarity web coverage and performance evaluation general discussion is given for each of these issues with examples of the ways they are addressed by existing engines and related references are given some concluding remarks and directions for future research are also presented
load sensitive faults cause program to fail when it is executed under heavy load or over long period of time but may have no detrimental effect under small loads or short executions in addition to testing the functionality of these programs testing how well they perform under stress is very important current approaches to stress or load testing treat the system as black box generating test data based on parameters specified by the tester within an operational profile in this paper we advocate structural approach to load testing there exist many structural testing methods however their main goal is generating test data for executing all statements branches definition use pairs or paths of program at least once without consideration for executing any particular path extensivelyour initial work has focused on the identification of potentially load sensitive modules based on static analysis of the module's code and then limiting the stress testing to the regions of the modules that could be the potential causes of the load sensitivity this analysis will be incorporated into testing tool for structural load testing which takes program as input and automatically determines whether that program needs to be load tested and if so automatically generates test data for structural load testing of the program
developing countries face significant challenges in network access making even simple network tasks unpleasant many standard techniques caching and predictive prefetching help somewhat but provide little or no assistance for personal data that is needed only by single user sulula addresses this problem by leveraging the near ubiquity of cellular phones able to send and receive simple sms messages rather than visit kiosk and fetch data on demand tiresome process at best users request future visit if capacity exists the kiosk can schedule secure retrieval of that user's data saving time and more efficiently utilizing the kiosk's limited connectivity when the user arrives at provisioned kiosk she need only obtain the session key on demand and thereafter has instant access in addition sulula allows users to schedule data uploads experimental results show significant gains for the end user saving tens of minutes of time for typical email news reading session we also describe small ongoing deployment in country for proof of concept lessons learned from that experience and provide discussion on pricing and marketplace issues that remain to be addressed to make the system viable for developing world access
process support systems psss are software systems supporting the modeling enactment monitoring and analysis of business processes process automation technology can be fully exploited when predictable and repetitive processes are executed unfortunately many processes are faced with the need of managing exceptional situations that may occur during their execution and possibly even more exceptions and failures can occur when the process execution is supported by pss exceptional situations may be caused by system hardware or software failures or may by related to the semantics of the business processin this paper we introduce taxonomy of failures and exceptions and discuss the effect that they can have on pss and on its ability to support business processes then we present the main approaches that commercial psss and research prototypes offer in order to capture and react to exceptional situations and we show which classes of failure or exception can be managed by each approach

in large scale sensor networks sensor nodes are at high risk of being captured and compromised once sensor node is compromised all the secret keys data and code stored on it are exposed to the attacker the attacker can insert arbitrary malicious code in the compromised node moreover he can easily replicate it in large number of clones and deploy them on the network this node replication attack can form the basis of variety of attacks such as dos attacks and sybil attacks previous studies of node replication attacks have had some drawbacks they need central trusted entity or they become vulnerable when many nodes are compromised therefore we propose distributed protocol for detecting node replication attacks that is resilient to many compromised nodes our method does not need any reliable entities and has high detection rate of replicated nodes our analysis and simulations demonstrate our protocol is effective even when there are large number of compromised nodes
developing and maintaining open source software has become an important source of profit for many companies change prone classes in open source products increase project costs by requiring developers to spend effort and time identifying and characterizing change prone classes can enable developers to focus timely preventive actions for example peer reviews and inspections on the classes with similar characteristics in the future releases or products in this study we collected set of static metrics and change data at class level from two open source projects koffice and mozilla using these data we first tested and validated pareto's law which implies that great majority around of change is rooted in small proportion around of classes then we identified and characterized the change prone classes in the two products by producing tree based models in addition using tree based models we suggested prioritization strategy to use project resources for focused preventive actions in an efficient manner our empirical results showed that this strategy was effective for prioritization purposes this study should provide useful guidance to practitioners involved in development and maintenance of large scale open source products
we study auctions whose bidders are embedded in social or economic network as result even bidders who do not win the auction themselves might derive utility from the auction namely when friend wins on the other hand when an enemy or competitor wins bidder might derive negative utility such spite and altruism will alter the bidding strategies simple and natural model for bidders utilities in these settings posits that the utility of losing bidder as result of bidder winning is constant positive or negative fraction of bidder j's utilitywe study such auctions under bayesian model in which all valuations are distributed independently according to known distribution but the actual valuations are private we describe and analyze nash equilibrium bidding strategies in two broad classes regular friendship networks with arbitrary valuation distributions and arbitrary friendship networks with identical uniform valuation distributions
the process of network debugging is commonly guided by decision trees that describe and attempt to address the most common failure modes we show that troubleshooting can be made more effective by converting decision trees into suites of convergent troubleshooting scripts that do not change network attributes unless these are out of compliance with accepted norms maelstrom is tool for managing and coordinating execution of these scripts maelstrom exploits convergence of individual scripts to dynamically infer an appropriate execution order for the scripts it accomplishes this in procedure trials where is the number of troubleshooting scripts this greatly eases adding scripts to troubleshooting scheme and thus makes it easier for people to cooperate in producing more exhaustive and effective troubleshooting schemes
recent studies have indicated an increase in customer profiling techniques used by commerce businesses commerce businesses are creating maintaining and utilising customer profiles to assist in personalisation personalisation can help improve customers satisfaction levels purchasing behaviour loyalty and subsequently improve sales the continuously changing customer needs and preferences pose challenge to commerce businesses on how to maintain and update individual customer profiles to reflect any changes in customers needs and preferences this research set out to investigate how dynamic customer profile for on line customers can be updated and maintained taking into consideration individual web visitors activities the research designed and implemented decision model that analysed on line customers activities during interaction sessions and determined whether to update customers profiles or not evaluation results indicated that the model was able to analyse the on line customers activities from log file and successfully updated the customers profiles based on the customer activities undertaken during the interaction session
unlike conventional rule based knowledge bases kbs that support monotonic reasoning key correctness issue ie the correctness of sub kb with respect to the full kb arises when using kb represented by non monotonic reasoning languages such as answer set programming asp since user may have rights to access only subset of kb the non monotonic nature of asp may cause the occurrence of consequences which are erroneous in the sense that the consequences are not reasonable in the full kb this paper proposes an approach dealing with the problem the main idea is to let the usage of closed world assumptions cwas for literals in kb satisfy certain constraints two kinds of access right propositions are created rule retrieval right propositions to control the access to rules and cwa right propositions to control the usage of cwas for literals based on these right propositions this paper first defines an algorithm for translating an original kb into kb tagged by right propositions and then discusses the right dependency in kb and proposes methods for checking and obtaining set of rights that is closed under set of dependency rules finally several results on the correctness of set of rights in kb are presented which serve as guidelines for the correct use of kb as an example kb of illness related financial support for teachers of university is presented to illustrate the application of our approach
the minimum energy broadcast routing problem was extensively studied during the last years given sample space where wireless devices are distributed the aim is to perform the broadcast communication pattern from given source while minimising the total energy consumption while many papers deal with the dimensional case where the sample space is given by plain area few results are known about the more interesting and practical dimensional case in this paper we study this case and we present tighter analysis of the minimum spanning tree heuristic in order to considerably decrease its approximation factor from the known to roughly this decreases the gap with the known lower bound of given by the so called dimensional kissing number
the collection of digital information by governments corporations and individuals has created tremendous opportunities for knowledge and information based decision making driven by mutual benefits or by regulations that require certain data to be published there is demand for the exchange and publication of data among various parties data in its original form however typically contains sensitive information about individuals and publishing such data will violate individual privacy the current practice in data publishing relies mainly on policies and guidelines as to what types of data can be published and on agreements on the use of published data this approach alone may lead to excessive data distortion or insufficient protection privacy preserving data publishing ppdp provides methods and tools for publishing useful information while preserving data privacy recently ppdp has received considerable attention in research communities and many approaches have been proposed for different data publishing scenarios in this survey we will systematically summarize and evaluate different approaches to ppdp study the challenges in practical data publishing clarify the differences and requirements that distinguish ppdp from other related problems and propose future research directions
customized processors use compiler analysis and design automation techniques to take generalized architectural model and create specific instance of it which is optimized to given application or set of applications these processors offer the promise of satisfying the high performance needs of the embedded community while simultaneously shrinking design times finite state machines fsm are fundamental building block in computer architecture and are used to control and optimize all types of prediction and speculation now even in the embedded space they are used for branch prediction cache replacement policies and confidence estimation and accuracy counters for variety of optimizations in this paper we present framework for automated design of small fsm predictors for customized processors our approach can be used to automatically generate small fsm predictors to perform well over suite of applications tailored to specific application or even specific instruction we evaluate the use of these customized fsm predictors for branch prediction over set of benchmarks
scaling of interconnects exacerbates the already challenging reliability of on chip networks although many researchers have provided various fault handling techniques in chip multi processors cmps the fault tolerance of the interconnection network is yet to adequately evolve as an end to end recovery approach delays fault detection and complicates recovery to consistent global state in such system link level retransmission is endorsed for recovery making higher level protocol simple in this paper we introduce fault tolerant flow control scheme for soft error handling in on chip networks the fault tolerant flow control recovers errors at link level by requesting retransmission and ensures an error free transmission on flit basis with incorporation of dynamic packet fragmentation dynamic packet fragmentation is adopted as part of fault tolerant flow control to disengage flits from the fault containment and recover the faulty flit transmission thus the proposed router provides high level of dependability at the link level for both datapath and control planes in simulation with injected faults the proposed router is observed to perform well gracefully degrading while exhibiting error coverage in datapath elements the proposed router has been implemented using tsmc nm standard cell library as compared to router which employs triple modular redundancy tmr in datapath elements the proposed router takes less area and consumes less energy per packet on average

the management of hierarchically organized data is starting to play key role in the knowledge management community due to the proliferation of topic hierarchies for text documents the creation and maintenance of such organized repositories of information requires great deal of human interventionthe machine learning community has partially addressed this problem by developing hierarchical supervised classifiers that help people categorize new resources within given hierarchies the worst problem of hierarchical supervised classifiers however is their high demand in terms of labeled examples the number of examples required is related to the number of topics in the taxonomy bootstrapping huge hierarchy with proper set of labeled examples is therefore critical issuethis paper proposes some solutions for the bootstrapping problem that implicitly or explicitly use taxonomy definition baseline approach that classifies documents according to the class terms and two clustering approaches whose training is constrained by the priori knowledge encoded in the taxonomy structure which consists of both terminological and relational aspects in particular we propose the tax som model that clusters set of documents in predefined hierarchy of classes directly exploiting the knowledge of both their topological organization and their lexical description experimental evaluation was performed on set of taxonomies taken from the googletm and looksmarttm web directories obtaining good results
the traditional interaction mechanism with database system is through the use of query language the most widely used one being sql however when one is facing situation where he or she has to make minor modification to previously issued sql query either the whole query has to be written from scratch or one has to invoke an editor to edit the query this however is not the way we converse with each other as humans during the course of conversation the preceding interaction is used as context within which many incomplete and or incremental phrases are uniquely and unambiguously interpreted sparing the need to repeat the same things again and again in this paper we present an effective mechanism that allows user to interact with database system in way similar to the way humans converse more specifically incomplete sql queries are accepted as input which are then matched to identified parts of previously issued queries disambiguation is achieved by using various types of semantic information the overall method works independently of the domain under which it is used ie independently of the database schema several algorithms that are variations of the same basic mechanism are proposed they are mutually compared with respect to efficiency and accuracy through limited set of experiments on human subjects the results have been encouraging especially when semantic knowledge from the schema is exploited laying potential foundation for conversational querying in databases
learned activity specific motion models are useful for human pose and motion estimation nevertheless while the use of activity specific models simplifies monocular tracking it leaves open the larger issues of how one learns models for multiple activities or stylistic variations and how such models can be combined with natural transitions between activities this paper extends the gaussian process latent variable model gp lvm to address some of these issues we introduce new approach to constraining the latent space that we refer to as the locally linear gaussian process latent variable model ll gplvm the ll gplvm allows for an explicit prior over the latent configurations that aims to preserve local topological structure in the training data we reduce the computational complexity of the gplvm by adapting sparse gaussian process regression methods to the gp lvm by incorporating sparsification dynamics and back constraints within the ll gplvm we develop general framework for learning smooth latent models of different activities within shared latent space allowing the learning of specific topologies and transitions between different activities
effective system verification requires good specifications the lack of sufficient specifications can lead to misses of critical bugs design re spins and time to market slips in this paper we present new technique for mining temporal specifications from simulation or execution traces of digital hardware design given an execution trace we mine recurring temporal behaviors in the trace that match set of pattern templates subsequently we synthesize them into complex patterns by merging events in time and chaining the patterns using inference rules we specifically designed our algorithm to make it highly efficient and meaningful for digital circuits in addition we propose pattern mining diagnosis framework where specifications mined from correct and erroneous traces are used to automatically localize an error we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on industrial size examples by mining specifications from traces of over million cycles in few minutes and use them to successfully localize errors of different types to within module boundaries
mobile robots that interact with humans in an intuitive way must be able to follow directions provided by humans in unconstrained natural language in this work we investigate how statistical machine translation techniques can be used to bridge the gap between natural language route instructions and map of an environment built by robot our approach uses training data to learn to translate from natural language instructions to an automatically labeled map the complexity of the translation process is controlled by taking advantage of physical constraints imposed by the map as result our technique can efficiently handle uncertainty in both map labeling and parsing our experiments demonstrate the promising capabilities achieved by our approach
haskell programmers often use multi parameter type class in which one or more type parameters are functionally dependent on the first although such functional dependencies have proved quite popular in practice they express the programmer's intent somewhat indirectly developing earlier work on associated data types we propose to add functionally dependent types as type synonyms to type class bodies these associated type synonyms constitute an interesting new alternative to explicit functional dependencies
software monitoring is technique that is well suited to supporting the development of dependable system it has been widely applied not only for this purpose but also for other purposes such as debugging security performance evaluation and enhancement etc however there is an inherent gap between the levels of abstraction of the information that is collected during software monitoring the implementation level and that of the software architecture level where many design decisions are made unless an immediate structural one to one architecture to implementation mapping takes place we need specification language to describe how low level events are related to higher level ones although some specification languages for monitoring have been proposed in the literature they do not provide support up to the software architecture level in addition these languages make it harder to link to and reuse information from other event based models often employed for reliability analysis in this paper we discuss the importance of event description as an integration element for architecting dependable systems
there is growing interest in algorithms for processing and querying continuous data streams ie data seen only once in fixed order with limited memory resources in its most general form data stream is actually an update stream ie comprising data item deletions as well as insertions such massive update streams arise naturally in several application domains eg monitoring of large ip network installations or processing of retail chain transactions estimating the cardinality of set expressions defined over several possibly distributed update streams is perhaps one of the most fundamental query classes of interest as an example such query may ask xc what is the number of distinct ip source addresses seen in passing packets from both router sub sub and sub sub but not router sub sub xd earlier work only addressed very restricted forms of this problem focusing solely on the special case of insert only streams and specific operators eg union in this paper we propose the first space efficient algorithmic solution for estimating the cardinality of full fledged set expressions over general update streams our estimation algorithms are probabilistic in nature and rely on novel hash based synopsis data structure termed xd level hash sketch xd we demonstrate how our level hash sketch synopses can be used to provide low error high confidence estimates for the cardinality of set expressions including operators such as set union intersection and difference over continuous update streams using only space that is significantly sublinear in the sizes of the streaming input multi sets furthermore our estimators never require rescanning or resampling of past stream items regardless of the number of deletions in the stream we also present lower bounds for the problem demonstrating that the space usage of our estimation algorithms is within small factors of the optimal finally we propose an optimized time efficient stream synopsis based on level hash sketches that provides similar strong accuracy space guarantees while requiring only guaranteed logarithmic maintenance time per update thus making our methods applicable for truly rapid rate data streams our results from an empirical study of our synopsis and estimation techniques verify the effectiveness of our approach

soft state is an often cited yet vague concept in network protocol design in which two or more network entities intercommunicate in loosely coupled often anonymous fashion researchers often define this concept operationally if at all rather than analytically source of soft state transmits periodic refresh messages over lossy communication channel to one or more receivers that maintain copy of that state which in turn expires if the periodic updates cease though number of crucial internet protocol building blocks are rooted in soft state based designs eg rsvp refresh messages pim membership updates various routing protocol updates rtcp control messages directory services like sap and so forth controversy is building as to whether the performance overhead of soft state refresh messages justify their qualitative benefit of enhanced system robustness we believe that this controversy has risen not from fundamental performance tradeoffs but rather from our lack of comprehensive understanding of soft state to better understand these tradeoffs we propose herein formal model for soft state communication based on probabilistic delivery model with relaxed reliability using this model we conduct queueing analysis and simulation to characterize the data consistency and performance tradeoffs under range of workloads and network loss rates we then extend our model with feedback and show through simulation that adding feedback dramatically improves data consistency by up to without increasing network resource consumption our model not only provides foundation for understanding soft state but also induces new fundamental transport protocol based on probabilistic delivery toward this end we sketch our design of the soft state transport protocol sstp which enjoys the robustness of soft state while retaining the performance benefit of hard state protocols like tcp through its judicious use of feedback
the development of the semantic web will require agents to use common domain ontologies to facilitate communication of conceptual knowledge however the proliferation of domain ontologies may also result in conflicts between the meanings assigned to the various terms that is agents with diverse ontologies may use different terms to refer to the same meaning or the same term to refer to different meanings agents will need method for learning and translating similar semantic concepts between diverse ontologies only until recently have researchers diverged from the last decade's ldquo common ontology rdquo paradigm to paradigm involving agents that can share knowledge using diverse ontologies this paper describes how we address this agent knowledge sharing problem of how agents deal with diverse ontologies by introducing methodology and algorithms for multi agent knowledge sharing and learning in peer to peer setting we demonstrate how this approach will enable multi agent systems to assist groups of people in locating translating and sharing knowledge using our distributed ontology gathering group integration environment doggie and describe our proof of concept experiments doggie synthesizes agent communication machine learning and reasoning for information sharing in the web domain
we propose an energy efficient framework called saf for approximate querying and clustering of nodes in sensor network saf uses simple time series forecasting models to predict sensor readings the idea is to build these local models at each node transmit them to the root of the network the sink and use them to approximately answer user queries our approach dramatically reduces communication relative to previous approaches for querying sensor networks by exploiting properties of these local models since each sensor communicates with the sink only when its local model varies due to changes in the underlying data distribution in our experimental results performed on trace of real data we observed on average about message transmissions from each sensor over week including the learning phase to correctly predict temperatures to within csaf also provides mechanism to detect data similarities between nodes and organize nodes into clusters at the sink at no additional communication cost this is again achieved by exploiting properties of our local time series models and by means of novel definition of data similarity between nodes that is based not on raw data but on the prediction values our clustering algorithm is both very efficient and provably optimal in the number of clusters our clusters have several interesting features first they can capture similarity between far away nodes that are not geographically adjacent second cluster membership to variations in sensors local models third nodes within cluster are not required to track the membership of other nodes in the cluster we present number of simulation based experimental results that demonstrate these properties of saf
good spatial locality alleviates both the latency and bandwidth problem of memory by boosting the effect of prefetching and improving the utilization of cache however conventional definitions of spatial locality are inadequate for programmer to precisely quantify the quality of program to identify causes of poor locality and to estimate the potential by which spatial locality can be improved this paper describes new component based model for spatial locality it is based on measuring the change of reuse distances as function of the data block size it divides spatial locality into components at program and behavior levels while the base model is costly because it requires the tracking of the locality of every memory access the overhead can be reduced by using small inputs and by extending sampling based tool the paper presents the result of the analysis for large set of benchmarks the cost of the analysis and the experience of user study in which the analysis helped to locate data layout problem and improve performance by with line change in an application with over lines
this paper presents novel technique anatomy for publishing sensitive data anatomy releases all the quasi identifier and sensitive values directly in two separate tables combined with grouping mechanism this approach protects privacy and captures large amount of correlation in the microdata we develop linear time algorithm for computing anatomized tables that obey the diversity privacy requirement and minimize the error of reconstructing the microdata extensive experiments confirm that our technique allows significantly more effective data analysis than the conventional publication method based on generalization specifically anatomy permits aggregate reasoning with average error below which is lower than the error obtained from generalized table by orders of magnitude
in response to long lasting anticipation by the java community version of the java platform referred to as java introduced generic types and methods to the java language the java generics are significant enhancement to the language expressivity because they allow straightforward composition of new generic classes from existing ones while reducing the need for plethora of type casts while the java generics are expressive the chosen implementation method type erasure has triggered undesirable orthogonality violations this paper identifies six cases of orthogonality violations in the java generics and demonstrates how these violations are mandated by the use of type erasure the paper also compares the java cases of orthogonality violations to compatible cases in and nextgen and analyzes the tradeoffs in the three approaches the conclusion is that java users face new challenges number of generic type expressions are forbidden while others that are allowed are left unchecked by the compiler
compared to traditional text classification with flat category set or small hierarchy of categories classifying web pages to large scale hierarchy such as open directory project odp and yahoo directory is challenging while recently proposed deep classification method makes the problem tractable it still suffers from low classification performance major problem is the lack of training data which is unavoidable with such huge hierarchy training pages associated with the category nodes are short and their distributions are skewed to alleviate the problem we propose new training data selection strategy and na iuml ve bayes combination model which utilize both local and global information we conducted series of experiments with the odp hierarchy containing more than categories to show that the proposed method of using both local and global information indeed helps avoiding the training data sparseness problem outperforming the state of art method
without proper simplification techniques database integrity checking can be prohibitively time consuming several methods have been developed for producing simplified incremental checks for each update but none until now of sufficient quality and generality for providing true practical impact and the present paper is an attempt to fill this gap on the theoretical side general characterization is introduced of the problem of simplification of integrity constraints and natural definition is given of what it means for simplification procedure to be ideal we prove that ideality of simplification is strictly related to query containment in fact an ideal simplification pro cedure can only exist in database languages for which query containment is decidable however simplifications that do not qualify as ideal may also be relevant for practical purposes we present concrete approach based on transformation operators that apply to integrity constraints written in rich datalog like language with negation the resulting procedure produces at design time simplified constraints for parametric transaction patterns which can then be instantiated and checked for consistency at run time these tests take place before the execution of the update so that only consistency preserving updates are eventually given to the database the extension to more expressive languages and the application of the framework to other contexts such as data integration and concurrent database systems are also discussed our experiments show that the simplifications obtained with our method may give rise to much better performance than with previous methods and that further improvements are achieved by checking consistency before executing the update
what distinguishes commerce from ordinary commerce what distinguishes it from distributed computation in this paper we propose performative theory of commerce drawing on speech act theory in which commerce exchanges are promises of future commercial actions whose real world meanings are constructed jointly and incrementally we then define computational model for this theory called posit spaces along with the syntax and semantics for an agent interaction protocol the posit spaces protocol or psp this protocol enables participants in multi agent commercial interaction to propose accept modify and revoke joint commitments our work integrates three strands of prior research the theory of tuple spaces in distributed computation formal dialogue games from argumentation theory and the study of commitments in multi agent systems
traffic anomalies such as failures and attacks are increasing in frequency and severity and thus identifying them rapidly and accurately is critical for large network operators the detection typically treats the traffic as collection of flows and looks for heavy changes in traffic patterns eg volume number of connections however as link speeds and the number of flows increase keeping per flow state is not scalable the recently proposed sketch based schemes are among the very few that can detect heavy changes and anomalies over massive data streams at network traffic speeds however sketches do not preserve the key eg source ip address of the flows hence even if anomalies are detected it is difficult to infer the culprit flows making it big practical hurdle for online deployment meanwhile the number of keys is too large to record to address this challenge we propose efficient reversible hashing algorithms to infer the keys of culprit flows from sketches without storing any explicit key information no extra memory or memory accesses are needed for recording the streaming data meanwhile the heavy change detection daemon runs in the background with space complexity and computational time sublinear to the key space size this short paper describes the conceptual framework of the reversible sketches as well as some initial approaches for implementation see for the optimized algorithms in details comment we further apply various emph ip mangling algorithms and emph bucket classification methods to reduce the false positives and false negatives evaluated with netflow traffic traces of large edge router we demonstrate that the reverse hashing can quickly infer the keys of culprit flows even for many changes with high accuracy
software bugs in routers lead to network outages security vulnerabilities and other unexpected behavior rather than simply crashing the router bugs can violate protocol semantics rendering traditional failure detection and recovery techniques ineffective handling router bugs is an increasingly important problem as new applications demand higher availability and networks become better at dealing with traditional failures in this paper we tailor software and data diversity sdd to the unique properties of routing protocols so as to avoid buggy behavior at run time our bug tolerant router executes multiple diverse instances of routing software and uses voting to determine the output to publish to the forwarding table or to advertise to neighbors we design and implement router hypervisor that makes this parallelism transparent to other routers handles fault detection and booting of new router instances and performs voting in the presence of routing protocol dynamics without needing to modify software of the diverse instances experiments with bgp message traces and open source software running on our linux based router hypervisor demonstrate that our solution scales to large networks and efficiently masks buggy behavior
commercially available database systems do not meet the information and processing needs of design and manufacturing environments new generation of systems engineering information systems must be built to meet these needs the architectural and computational aspects of such systems are addressed and solutions are proposed the authors argue that mainframe workstation architecture is needed to provide distributed functionality while ensuring high availability and low communication overhead that explicit control of metaknowledge is needed to support extendibility and evolution that large rule bases are needed to make the knowledge of the systems active and that incremental computation models are needed to achieve the required performance of such engineering information systems

scheduling algorithms used in compilers traditionally focus on goals such as reducing schedule length and register pressure or producing compact code in the context of hardware synthesis system where the schedule is used to determine various components of the hardware including datapath storage and interconnect the goals of scheduler change drastically in addition to achieving the traditional goals the scheduler must proactively make decisions to ensure efficient hardware is produced this paper proposes two exact solutions for cost sensitive modulo scheduling one based on an integer linear programming formulation and another based on branch and bound search to achieve reasonable compilation times decomposition techniques to break down the complex scheduling problem into phase ordered sub problems are proposed the decomposition techniques work either by partitioning the dataflow graph into smaller subgraphs and optimally scheduling the subgraphs or by splitting the scheduling problem into two phases time slot and resource assignment the effectiveness of cost sensitive modulo scheduling in minimizing the costs of function units register structures and interconnection wires are evaluated within fully automatic synthesis system for loop accelerators the cost sensitive modulo scheduler increases the efficiency of the resulting hardware significantly compared to both traditional cost unaware and greedy cost aware modulo schedulers

packet based on chip networks are increasingly being adopted in complex system on chip soc designs supporting numerous homogeneous and heterogeneous functional blocks these network on chip noc architectures are required to not only provide ultra low latency but also occupy small footprint and consume as little energy as possible further reliability is rapidly becoming major challenge in deep sub micron technologies due to the increased prominence of permanent faults resulting from accelerated aging effects and manufacturing testing challenges towards the goal of designing low latency energyefficient and reliable on chip communication networks we propose novel fine grained modular router architecture the proposed architecture employs decoupled parallel arbiters and uses smaller crossbars for row and column connections to reduce output port contention probabilities as compared to existing designs furthermore the router employs new switch allocation technique known as mirroring effect to reduce arbitration depth and increase concurrency in addition the modular design permits graceful degradation of the network in the event of permanent faults and also helps to reduce the dynamic power consumption our simulation results indicate that in an mesh network the proposed architecture reduces packet latency by and power consumption by as compared to two existing router architectures evaluation using combined performance energy and fault tolerance metric indicates that the proposed architecture provides overall improvement compared to the two earlier routers
the world wide web has undergone major changes in recent years the idea to see the web as platform for services instead of one way source of information has come along with number of new applications such as photo and video sharing portals and wikisin this paper we study how these changes affect the nature of the data distributed over the world wide web to do so we compare two data traces collected at the web proxy server of the rwth aachen the first trace was recorded in the other more than seven years later in we show the major differences and the similarities between the two traces and compare our observations with other work the results indicate that traditional proxy caching is no longer effective in typical university networks

we describe compression model for semistructured documents called structural contexts model scm which takes advantage of the context information usually implicit in the structure of the text the idea is to use separate model to compress the text that lies inside each different structure type eg different xml tag the intuition behind scm is that the distribution of all the texts that belong to given structure type should be similar and different from that of other structure types we mainly focus on semistatic models and test our idea using word based huffman method this is the standard for compressing large natural language text databases because random access partial decompression and direct search of the compressed collection is possible this variant dubbed scmhuff retains those features and improves huffman's compression ratios we consider the possibility that storing separate models may not pay off if the distribution of different structure types is not different enough and present heuristic to merge models with the aim of minimizing the total size of the compressed database this gives an additional improvement over the plain technique the comparison against existing prototypes shows that among the methods that permit random access to the collection scmhuff achieves the best compression ratios better than the closest alternative from purely compression aimed perspective we combine scm with ppm modeling separate ppm model is used to compress the text that lies inside each different structure type the result scmppm does not permit random access nor direct search in the compressed text but it gives better compression ratios than other techniques for texts longer than mb
this paper presents general framework for determining average program execution times and their variance based on the program's interval structure and control dependence graph average execution times and variance values are computed using frequency information from an optimized counter based execution profile of the program
using analysis simulation and experimentation we examine the threat against anonymous communications posed by passive logging attacks in previous work we analyzed the success of such attacks under various assumptions here we evaluate the effects of these assumptions more closely first we analyze the onion routing based model used in prior work in which fixed set of nodes remains in the system indefinitely we show that for this model by removing the assumption of uniformly random selection of nodes for placement in the path initiators can greatly improve their anonymity second we show by simulation that attack times are significantly lower in practice than bounds given by analytical results from prior work third we analyze the effects of dynamic membership model in which nodes are allowed to join and leave the system we show that all known defenses fail more quickly when the assumption of static node set is relaxed fourth intersection attacks against peer to peer systems are shown to be an additional danger either on their own or in conjunction with the predecessor attack finally we address the question of whether the regular communication patterns required by the attacks exist in real traffic we collected and analyzed the web requests of users to determine the extent to which basic patterns can be found we show that for our study frequent and repeated communication to the same web site is common
methods of top search with no random access can be used to find best objects using sorted access to the sources of attribute values in this paper we present new heuristics over the nra algorithm that can be used for fast search of top objects using wide range of user preferences nra algorithm usually needs periodical scan of large number of candidates during the computation in this paper we propose methods of no random access top search that optimize the candidate list maintenance during the computation to speed up the search the proposed methods are compared to table scan method typically used in databases we present results of experiments showing speed improvement depending on number of object attributes expressed in user preferences or selectivity of user preferences
the mapreduce framework is increasingly being used to analyze large volumes of data one important type of data analysis done with mapreduce is log processing in which click stream or an event log is filtered aggregated or mined for patterns as part of this analysis the log often needs to be joined with reference data such as information about users although there have been many studies examining join algorithms in parallel and distributed dbmss the mapreduce framework is cumbersome for joins mapreduce programmers often use simple but inefficient algorithms to perform joins in this paper we describe crucial implementation details of number of well known join strategies in mapreduce and present comprehensive experimental comparison of these join techniques on node hadoop cluster our results provide insights that are unique to the mapreduce platform and offer guidance on when to use particular join algorithm on this platform
we propose dialogue game protocol for purchase negotiation dialogues which identifies appropriate speech acts defines constraints on their utterances and specifies the different sub tasks agents need to perform in order to engage in dialogues according to this protocol our formalism combines dialogue game similar to those in the philosophy of argumentation with model of rational consumer purchase decision behaviour adopted from marketing theory in addition to the dialogue game protocol we present portfolio of decision mechanisms for the participating agents engaged in the dialogue and use these to provide our formalism with an operational semantics we show that these decision mechanisms are sufficient to generate automated purchase decision dialogues between autonomous software agents interacting according to our proposed dialogue game protocol
the increasing size and complexity of many software systems demand greater emphasis on capturing and maintaining knowledge at many different levels within the software development process this knowledge includes descriptions of the hardware and software components and their behavior external and internal design specifications and support for system testing the knowledge based software engineering kbse research paradigm is concerned with systems that use formally represented knowledge with associated inference precedures to support the various subactivities of software development as they growing scale kbse systems must balance expressivity and inferential power with the real demands of knowledge base construction maintenance performance and comprehensibility description logics dls possess several features mdash terminological orientation formal semantics and efficient reasoning procedures mdash which offer an effective tradeoff of these factors we discuss three kbse systems in which dls capture some of the requisite knowledge needed to support design coding and testing activities we then survey some alternative approaches to dls in kbse systems we close with discussion of the benefits of dls and ways to address some of their limitations
this paper shows an asymptotically tight analysis of the certified write all algorithm called awt that was introduced by anderson and woll siam comput and method for creating near optimal instances of the algorithm this algorithm is the best known deterministic algorithm that can be used to simulate synchronous parallel processors on asynchronous processors the algorithm is instantiated with permutations on where can be chosen from wide range of values when implementing simulation on specific parallel system with processors one would like to select the best possible value of and the best possible permutations in order to maximize the efficiency of the simulationthis paper shows that work complexity of any instance of awt is logq where is the number of permutations selected and is value related to their combinatorial properties the choice of turns out to be critical for obtaining an instance of the awt algorithm with near optimal work for any and any large enough work of any instance of the algorithm must be at least ln ln ln under certain conditions however that is about ln ln ln and for infinitely many large enough this lower bound can be nearly attained by instances of the algorithm that use certain permutations and have work at most ln ln ln the paper also shows penalty for not selecting well when is significantly away from ln ln ln then work of any instance of the algorithm with this displaced must be considerably higher than otherwise
two or more components eg objects modules or programs interoperate when they exchange data such as xml data using application programming interface api calls exported by xml parsers remains primary mode of accessing and manipulating xml and these api calls lead to various run time errors in components that exchange xml data currently no tool checks the source code of interoperating components for potential flaws caused by third party api calls that lead to incorrect xml data exchanges and runtime errors even when components are located within the same application our solution combines program abstraction and symbolic execution in order to reengineer the approximate schema of xml data that would be output by component this schema is compared using bisimulation with the schema of xml data that is expected by some other components we describe our approach and give our error checking algorithm we implemented our approach in tool that we used on open source and commercial systems and discovered errors that were not detected during their design and testing
outsourcing the training of support vector machines svm to external service providers benefits the data owner who is not familiar with the techniques of the svm or has limited computing resources in outsourcing the data privacy is critical issue for some legal or commercial reasons since there may be sensitive information contained in the data existing privacy preserving svm works are either not applicable to outsourcing or weak in security in this paper we propose scheme for privacy preserving outsourcing the training of the svm without disclosing the actual content of the data to the service provider in the proposed scheme the data sent to the service provider is perturbed by random transformation and the service provider trains the svm for the data owner from the perturbed data the proposed scheme is stronger in security than existing techniques and incurs very little redundant communication and computation cost
representation exposure is well known problem in the object oriented realm object encapsulation mechanisms have established tradition for solving this problem based on principle of reference containment this paper proposes novel type system which is based on different principle we call effect encapsulation which confines side effects rather than object references according to an ownership structure compared to object encapsulation effect encapsulation liberates us from the restriction on object referenceability and offers more flexibility in this paper we show that effect encapsulation can be statically type checked
set based program analysis establishes constraints between sets of abstract values for all expressions in program solving the system of constraints produces conservative approximation to the program's runtime flow of valuessome practical set based analyses use explicit selectors to extract the relevant values from an approximation set for example if the analysis needs to determine the possible return values of procedure it uses the appropriate selector to extract the relevant component from the abstract representation of the procedurein this paper we show that this selector based approach complicates the constraint solving phase of the analysis too much and thus fails to scale up to realistic programming languages we demonstrate this claim with full fledged value flow analysis for case lambda multi branched version of lambda we show how both the theoretical underpinnings and the practical implementation become too complex in response we present variant of set based closure analysis that computes equivalent results in much more efficient manner
we argue that runtime program transformation partial evaluation and dynamic compilation are essential tools for automated generation of flexible highly interactive graphical interfaces in particular these techniques help bridge the gap between high level functional description and an efficient implementation to support our claim we describe our application of these techniques to functional implementation of vision real time visualization system that represents multivariate relations as nested interactors and to auto visual rule based system that designs vision visualizations from high level task specifications vision visualizations are specified using simple functional language these programs are transformed into cached dataflow graph partial evaluator is used on particular computation intensive function applications and the results are compiled to native code the functional representation simplifies generation of correct code and the program transformations ensure good performance we demonstrate why these transformations improve performance and why they cannot be done at compile time
building rules on top of ontologies is the ultimate goal of the logical layer of the semantic web to this aim an ad hoc markup language for this layer is currently under discussion it is intended to follow the tradition of hybrid knowledge representation and reasoning systems such as inline graphic mime subtype gif xlink sinline alt text mathcal al alt text inline graphic log that integrates the description logic inline graphic mime subtype gif xlink sinline alt text mathcal alc alt text inline graphic and the function free horn clausal language datalog in this paper we consider the problem of automating the acquisition of these rules for the semantic web we propose general framework for rule induction that adopts the methodological apparatus of inductive logic programming and relies on the expressive and deductive power of inline graphic mime subtype gif xlink sinline alt text mathcal al alt text inline graphic log the framework is valid whatever the scope of induction description versus prediction is yet for illustrative purposes we also discuss an instantiation of the framework which aims at description and turns out to be useful in ontology refinement
we present set of techniques for reducing the memory consumption of object oriented programs these techniques include analysis algorithms and optimizations that use the results of these analyses to eliminate fields with constant values reduce the sizes of fields based on the range of values that can appear in each field and eliminate fields with common default values or usage patterns we apply these optimizations both to fields declared by the programmer and to implicit fields in the runtime object header although it is possible to apply these techniques to any object oriented program we expect they will be particularly appropriate for memory limited embedded systemswe have implemented these techniques in the mit flex compiler system and applied them to the programs in the specjvm benchmark suite our experimental results show that our combined techniques can reduce the maximum live heap size required for the programs in our benchmark suite by as much as some of the optimizations reduce the overall execution time others may impose modest performance penalties
next generation decision support applications besides being capable of processing huge amounts of data require the ability to integrate and reason over data from multiple heterogeneous data sources often these data sources differ in variety of aspects such as their data models the query languages they support and their network protocols also typically they are spread over wide geographical area the cost of processing decision support queries in such setting is quite high however processing these queries often involves redundancies such as repeated access of same data source and multiple execution of similar processing sequences minimizing these redundancies would significantly reduce the query processing cost in this paper we propose an architecture for processing complex decision support queries involving multiple heterogeneous data sources introduce the notion of transient views mdash materialized views that exist only in the context of execution of query mdash that is useful for minimizing the redundancies involved in the execution of these queries develop cost based algorithm that takes query plan as input and generates an optimal ldquo covering plan rdquo by minimizing redundancies in the original plan validate our approach by means of an implementation of the algorithms and detailed performance study based on tpc benchmark queries on commercial database system and finally compare and contrast our approach with work in related areas in particular the areas of answering queries using views and optimization using common sub expressions our experiments demonstrate the practicality and usefulness of transient views in significantly improving the performance of decision support queries

warping the pointer across monitor bezels has previously been demonstrated to be both significantly faster and preferred to the standard mouse behavior when interacting across displays in homogeneous multi monitor configurations complementing this work we present user study that compares the performance of four pointer warping strategies including previously untested frame memory placement strategy in heterogeneous multi monitor environments where displays vary in size resolution and orientation our results show that new frame memory pointer warping strategy significantly improved targeting performance up to in some cases in addition our study showed that when transitioning across screens the mismatch between the visual and the device space has significantly bigger impact on performance than the mismatch in orientation and visual size alone for mouse operation in highly heterogeneous multi monitor environment all our participants strongly preferred using pointer warping over the regular mouse behavior
cloud computing is disruptive trend that is changing the way we use computers the key underlying technology in cloud infrastructures is virtualization so much so that many consider virtualization to be one of the key features rather than simply an implementation detail unfortunately the use of virtualization is the source of significant security concern because multiple virtual machines run on the same server and since the virtualization layer plays considerable role in the operation of virtual machine malicious party has the opportunity to attack the virtualization layer successful attack would give the malicious party control over the all powerful virtualization layer potentially compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the software and data of any virtual machine in this paper we propose removing the virtualization layer while retaining the key features enabled by virtualization our nohype architecture named to indicate the removal of the hypervisor addresses each of the key roles of the virtualization layer arbitrating access to cpu memory and devices acting as network device eg ethernet switch and managing the starting and stopping of guest virtual machines additionally we show that our nohype architecture may indeed be no hype since nearly all of the needed features to realize the nohype architecture are currently available as hardware extensions to processors and devices
effort prediction is very important issue for software project management historical project data sets are frequently used to support such prediction but missing data are often contained in these data sets and this makes prediction more difficult one common practice is to ignore the cases with missing data but this makes the originally small software project database even smaller and can further decrease the accuracy of prediction the alternative is missing data imputation there are many imputation methods software data sets are frequently characterised by their small size but unfortunately sophisticated imputation methods prefer larger data sets for this reason we explore using simple methods to impute missing data in small project effort data sets we propose class mean imputation cmi method based on the nn hot deck imputation method mini to impute both continuous and nominal missing data in small data sets we use an incremental approach to increase the variance of population to evaluate mini and nn and cmi methods as benchmarks we use data sets with cases and cases sampled from larger industrial data set with and missing data percentages respectively we also simulate missing completely at random mcar and missing at random mar missingness mechanisms the results suggest that the mini method outperforms both cmi and the nn methods we conclude that this new imputation technique can be used to impute missing values in small data sets
the number of mobile phone users has been steadily increasing due to the development of microtechnology and human needs for ubiquitous communication menu design features play significant role in cell phone design from the perspective of customer satisfaction moreover small screens of the type used on mobile phones are limited in the amount of available space therefore it is important to obtain good menu design review of previous menu design studies for human computer interaction suggests that design guidelines for mobile phones need to be reappraised especially display features we propose conceptual model for cell phone menu design with displays the three main factors included in the model are the number of items task complexity and task type
an ad hoc data source is any semistructured data source for which useful data analysis and transformation tools are not readily available such data must be queried transformed and displayed by systems administrators computational biologists financial analysts and hosts of others on regular basis in this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to generate suite of useful data processing tools including semi structured query engine several format converters statistical analyzer and data visualization routines directly from the ad hoc data itself without any human intervention the key technical contribution of the work is multi phase algorithm that automatically infers the structure of an ad hoc data source and produces format specification in the pads data description language programmers wishing to implement custom data analysis tools can use such descriptions to generate printing and parsing libraries for the data alternatively our software infrastructure will push these descriptions through the pads compiler creating format dependent modules that when linked with format independent algorithms for analysis and transformation result infully functional tools we evaluate the performance of our inference algorithm showing it scales linearlyin the size of the training data completing in seconds as opposed to the hours or days it takes to write description by hand we also evaluate the correctness of the algorithm demonstrating that generating accurate descriptions often requires less than of theavailable data
to manage the evolution of software systems effectively software developers must understand software systems identify and evaluate alternative modification strategies implement appropriate modifications and validate the correctness of the modifications one analysis technique that assists in many of these activities is program slicing to facilitate the application of slicing to large software systems we adapted control flow based interprocedural slicing algorithm so that it accounts for interprocedural control dependencies not recognized by other slicing algorithms and reuses slicing information for improved efficiency our initial studies suggest that additional slice accuracy and slicing efficiency may be achieved with our algorithm
this paper addresses necessary modification and extensions to existing grid computing approaches in order to meet modern business demand grid computing has been traditionally used to solve large scientific problems focussing more on accumulative use of computing power and processing large input and output files typical for many scientific problems nowadays businesses have increasing computational demands such that grid technologies are of interest however the existing business requirements introduce new constraints on the design configuration and operation of the underlying systems including availability of resources performance monitoring aspects security and isolation issues this paper addresses the existing grid computing capabilities discussing the additional demands in detail this results in suggestion of problem areas that must be investigated and corresponding technologies that should be used within future business grid systems
existing work on scheduling with energy concern has focused on minimizing the energy for completing all jobs or achieving maximum throughput that is energy usage is secondary concern when compared to throughput and the schedules targeted may be very poor in energy efficiency in this paper we attempt to put energy efficiency as the primary concern and study how to maximize throughput subject to user defined threshold of energy efficiency we first show that all deterministic online algorithms have competitive ratio at least where is the max min ratio of job size nevertheless allowing the online algorithm to have slightly poorer energy efficiency leads to constant ie independent of competitive online algorithm on the other hand using randomization we can reduce the competitive ratio to logδ without relaxing the efficiency threshold finally we consider special case where no jobs are demanding and give deterministic online algorithm with constant competitive ratio for this case
mapreduce and similar systems significantly ease the task of writing data parallel code however many real world computations require pipeline of mapreduces and programming and managing such pipelines can be difficult we present flumejava java library that makes it easy to develop test and run efficient data parallel pipelines at the core of the flumejava library are couple of classes that represent immutable parallel collections each supporting modest number of operations for processing them in parallel parallel collections and their operations present simple high level uniform abstraction over different data representations and execution strategies to enable parallel operations to run efficiently flumejava defers their evaluation instead internally constructing an execution plan dataflow graph when the final results of the parallel operations are eventually needed flumejava first optimizes the execution plan and then executes the optimized operations on appropriate underlying primitives eg mapreduces the combination of high level abstractions for parallel data and computation deferred evaluation and optimization and efficient parallel primitives yields an easy to use system that approaches the efficiency of hand optimized pipelines flumejava is in active use by hundreds of pipeline developers within google
in clustering based wireless sensor network wsn cluster heads play an important role by serving as data forwarders amongst other network organisation functions thus malfunctioning and or compromised sensor nodes that serve as cluster head ch can lead to unreliable data delivery in this paper we propose scheme called secure low energy clustering seclec that incorporates secure cluster head selection and distributed cluster head monitoring to achieve reliable data delivery the seclec framework is flexible and can accommodate various tracking and monitoring mechanisms our goal in this paper is to understand the performance impact of adding such security mechanisms to the clustering architecture in terms of energy consumed and prevented data losses our experiments show that with seclec bs detects such anomalous nodes with the latency of one network operation round and the data loss due to malicious nodes is up to with reasonable communication overhead
we present new technique failure oblivious computing that enables servers to execute through memory errors without memory corruption our safe compiler for inserts checks that dynamically detect invalid memory accesses instead of terminating or throwing an exception the generated code simply discards invalid writes and manufactures values to return for invalid reads enabling the server to continue its normal execution path we have applied failure oblivious computing to set of widely used servers from the linux based open source computing environment our results show that our techniques make these servers invulnerable to known security attacks that exploit memory errors and enable the servers to continue to operate successfully to service legitimate requests and satisfy the needs of their users even after attacks trigger their memory errors we observed several reasons for this successful continued execution when the memory errors occur in irrelevant computations failure oblivious computing enables the server to execute through the memory errors to continue on to execute the relevant computation even when the memory errors occur in relevant computations failure oblivious computing converts requests that trigger unanticipated and dangerous execution paths into anticipated invalid inputs which the error handling logic in the server rejects because servers tend to have small error propagation distances localized errors in the computation for one request tend to have little or no effect on the computations for subsequent requests redirecting reads that would otherwise cause addressing errors and discarding writes that would otherwise corrupt critical data structures such as the call stack localizes the effect of the memory errors prevents addressing exceptions from terminating the computation and enables the server to continue on to successfully process subsequent requests the overall result is substantial extension of the range of requests that the server can successfully process
multidatabase system mdbs integrates information from autonomous local databases managed by heterogeneous database management systems dbms in distributed environment for query involving more than one database global query optimization should be performed to achieve good overall system performance the significant differences between an mdbs and traditional distributed database system ddbs make query optimization in the former more challenging than in the latter challenges for query optimization in an mdbs are discussed in this paper two phase optimization approach for processing query in an mdbs is proposed several global query optimization techniques suitable for an mdbs such as semantic query optimization query optimization via probing queries parametric query optimization and adaptive query optimization are suggested the architecture of global query optimizer incorporating these techniques is designed
we present the design implementation and evaluation of beepbeep high accuracy acoustic based ranging system it operates in spontaneous ad hoc and device to device context without leveraging any pre planned infrastructure it is pure software based solution and uses only the most basic set of commodity hardware speaker microphone and some form of device to device communication so that it is readily applicable to many low cost sensor platforms and to most commercial off the shelf mobile devices like cell phones and pdas it achieves high accuracy through combination of three techniques two way sensing self recording and sample counting the basic idea is the following to estimate the range between two devices each will emit specially designed sound signal beep and collect simultaneous recording from its microphone each recording should contain two such beeps one from its own speaker and the other from its peer by counting the number of samples between these two beeps and exchanging the time duration information with its peer each device can derive the two way time of flight of the beeps at the granularity of sound sampling rate this technique cleverly avoids many sources of inaccuracy found in other typical time of arrival schemes such as clock synchronization non real time handling software delays etc our experiments on two common cell phone models have shown that we can achieve around one or two centimeters accuracy within range of more than ten meters despite series of technical challenges in implementing the idea
the ability of reconfiguring software architectures in order to adapt them to new requirements or changing environment has been of growing interest we propose uniform algebraic approach that improves on previous formal work in the area due to the following characteristics first components are written in high level program design language with the usual notion of state second the approach deals with typical problems such as guaranteeing that new components are introduced in the correct state possibly transferred from the old components they replace and that the resulting architecture conforms to certain structural constraints third reconfigurations and computations are explicitly related by keeping them separate this is because the approach provides semantics to given architecture through the algebraic construction of an equivalent program whose computations can be mirrored at the architectural level
developers and designers always strive for quality software quality software tends to be robust reliable and easy to maintain and thus reduces the cost of software development and maintenance several methods have been applied to improve software quality refactoring is one of those methods the goal of this paper is to validate invalidate the claims that refactoring improves software quality we focused this study on different external quality attributes which are adaptability maintainability understandability reusability and testability we found that refactoring does not necessarily improve these quality attributes
we investigate new approach to editing spatially and temporally varying measured materials that adopts stroke based workflow in our system user specifies small number of editing constraints with painting interface which are smoothly propagated to the entire dataset through an optimization that enforces similar edits are applied to areas with similar appearance the sparse nature of this appearance driven optimization permits the use of efficient solvers allowing the designer to interactively refine the constraints we have found this approach supports specifying wide range of complex edits that would not be easy with existing techniques which present the user with fixed segmentation of the data furthermore it is independent of the underlying reflectance model and we show edits to both analytic and non parametric representations in examples from several material databases
the circular sensing model has been widely used to estimate performance of sensing applications in existing analysis and simulations while this model provides valuable high level guidelines the quantitative results obtained may not reflect the true performance of these applications due to the existence of obstacles and sensing irregularity introduced by insufficient hardware calibration in this project we design and implement two sensing area modeling sam techniques useful in the real world they complement each other in the design space sam provides accurate sensing area models for individual nodes using controlled or monitored events while sam provides continuous sensing similarity models using natural events in an environment with these two models we pioneer an investigation of the impact of sensing irregularity on application performance such as coverage scheduling we evaluate sam extensively in real world settings using three testbeds consisting of micaz motes and xsm motes to study the performance at scale we also provide an extensive node simulation evaluation results reveal several serious issues concerning circular models and demonstrate significant improvements
the successful design and implementation of secure systems must occur from the beginning component that must process data at multiple security levels is very critical and must go through additional evaluation to ensure the processing is secure it is common practice to isolate and separate the processing of data at different levels into different components in this paper we present architecture based refinement techniques for the design of multilevel secure systems we discuss what security requirements must be satisfied through the refinement process including when separation works and when it does not the process oriented approach will lead to verified engineering techniques for secure systems which should greatly reduce the cost of certification of those systems
this paper presents an analysis of the performance effects of burstiness in multi tiered systems we introduce compact characterization of burstiness based on autocorrelation that can be used in capacity planning performance prediction and admission control we show that if autocorrelation exists either in the arrival or the service process of any of the tiers in multi tiered system then autocorrelation propagates to all tiers of the system we also observe the surprising result that in spite of the fact that the bottleneck resource in the system is far from saturation and that the measured throughput and utilizations of other resources are also modest user response times are very high when autocorrelation is not considered this underutilization of resources falsely indicates that the system can sustain higher capacities we examine the behavior of small queuing system that helps us understand this counter intuitive behavior and quantify the performance degradation that originates from autocorrelated flows we present case study in an experimental multi tiered internet server and devise model to capture the observed behavior our evaluation indicates that the model is in excellent agreement with experimental results and captures the propagation of autocorrelation in the multi tiered system and resulting performance trends finally we analyze an admission control algorithm that takes autocorrelation into account and improves performance by reducing the long tail of the response time distribution
in this article we propose techniques that enable efficient exploration of the design space where each logical block can span more than one silicon layer fine grain integration provides reduced intrablock wire delay as well as improved power consumption however the corresponding power and performance advantage is usually underutilized since various implementations of multilayer blocks require novel physical design and microarchitecture infrastructure to explore microarchitecture design space we develop cubic packing engine which can simultaneously optimize physical and architectural design for efficient vertical integration this technique selects the individual unit designs from set of single layer or multilayer implementations to get the best microarchitectural design in terms of performance temperature or both our experimental results using design driver of high performance superscalar processor show percnt performance improvement over traditional for layers and percnt over with single layer unit implementations since thermal characteristics of integrated circuits are among the main challenges thermal aware floorplanning and thermal via insertion techniques are employed to keep the peak temperatures below threshold
large scheduling windows are an effective mechanism for increasing microprocessor performance through the extraction of instruction level parallelism current techniques do not scale effectively for very large windows leading to slow wakeup and select logic as well as large complicated bypass networks this paper introduces new instruction scheduler implementation referred to as hierarchical scheduling windows or hsw which exploits latency tolerant instructions in order to reduce implementation complexity hsw yields very large instruction window that tolerates wakeup select and bypass latency while extracting significant far flung ilpresults it is shown that hsw loses performance per additional cycle of bypass select wakeup latency as compared to monolithic window that loses per additional cycle also hsw achieves the performance of traditional implementations with only to the number of entries in the critical timing path
bubba is highly parallel computer system for data intensive applications the basis of the bubba design is scalable shared nothing architecture which can scale up to thousands of nodes data are declustered across the nodes ie horizontally partitioned via hashing or range partitioning and operations are executed at those nodes containing relevant data in this way parallelism can be exploited within individual transactions as well as among multiple concurrent transactions to improve throughput and response times for data intensive applications the current bubba prototype runs on commercial node multicomputer and includes parallelizing compiler distributed transaction management object management and customized version of unix the current prototype is described and the major design decisions that went into its construction are discussed the lessons learned from this prototype and its predecessors are presented
in this article we consider whether traditional index structures are effective in processing unstable nearest neighbors workloads it is known that under broad conditions nearest neighbors workloads become unstable distances between data points become indistinguishable from each other we complement this earlier result by showing that if the workload for an application is unstable you are not likely to be able to index it efficiently using almost all known multidimensional index structures for broad class of data distributions we prove that these index structures will do no better than linear scan of the data as dimensionality increasesour result has implications for how experiments should be designed on index structures such as trees trees and sr trees simply put experiments trying to establish that these index structures scale with dimensionality should be designed to establish crossover points rather than to show that the methods scale to an arbitrary number of dimensions in other words experiments should seek to establish the dimensionality of the dataset at which the proposed index structure deteriorates to linear scan for each data distribution of interest that linear scan will eventually dominate is givenan important problem is to analytically characterize the rate at which index structures degrade with increasing dimensionality because the dimensionality of real data set may well be in the range that particular method can handle the results in this article can be regarded as step toward solving this problem although we do not characterize the rate at which structure degrades our techniques allow us to reason directly about broad class of index structures rather than the geometry of the nearest neighbors problem in contrast to earlier work
modeling is core software engineering practice conceptual models are constructed to establish an abstract understanding of the domain among stakeholders these are then refined into computational models that aim to realize conceptual specification the refinement process yields sets of models that are initially incomplete and inconsistent by nature the aim of the engineering process is to negotiate consistency and completeness toward stable state sufficient for deployment implementation this paper presents the notion of model ecosystem which permits the capability to guide analyst edits toward stability by computing consistency and completeness equilibria for conceptual models during periods of model change
several forms of reasoning in ai like abduction closed world reasoning circumscription and disjunctive logic programming are well known to be intractable in fact many of the relevant problems are on the second or third level of the polynomial hierarchy in this paper we show how the notion of treewidth can be fruitfully applied to this area in particular we show that all these problems become tractable actually even solvable in linear time if the treewidth of the involved formulae or programs is bounded by some constant clearly these theoretical tractability results as such do not immediately yield feasible algorithms however we have recently established new method based on monadic datalog which allowed us to design an efficient algorithm for related problem in the database area in this work we exploit the monadic datalog approach to construct new algorithms for logic based abduction

fairground thrill laboratory was series of live events that augmented the experience of amusement rides wearable telemetry system captured video audio heart rate and acceleration data streaming them live to spectator interfaces and watching audience in this paper we present study of this event which draws on video recordings and post event interviews and which highlights the experiences of riders spectators and ride operators our study shows how the telemetry system transformed riders into performers spectators into an audience and how the role of ride operator began to include aspects of orchestration with the relationship between all three roles also transformed critically the introduction of telemetry system seems to have had the potential to re connect riders performers back to operators orchestrators and spectators audience re introducing closer relationship that used to be available with smaller rides introducing telemetry to real world situation also creates significant complexity which we illustrate by focussing on moment of perceived crisis
in order to achieve good performance in object classification problems it is necessary to combine information from various image features because the large margin classifiers are constructed based on similarity measures between samples called kernels finding appropriate feature combinations boils down to designing good kernels among set of candidates for example positive mixtures of predetermined base kernels there are couple of ways to determine the mixing weights of multiple kernels uniform weights brute force search over validation set and multiple kernel learning mkl mkl is theoretically and technically very attractive because it learns the kernel weights and the classifier simultaneously based on the margin criterion however we often observe that the support vector machine svm with the average kernel works at least as good as mkl in this paper we propose as an alternative two step approach at first the kernel weights are determined by optimizing the kernel target alignment score and then the combined kernel is used by the standard svm with single kernel the experimental results with the voc data set show that our simple procedure outperforms the average kernel and mkl

in this paper we evaluate the atomic region compiler abstraction by incorporating it into commercial system we find that atomic regions are simple and intuitive to integrate into an binary translation system furthermore doing so trivially enables additional optimization opportunities beyond that achievable by high performance dynamic optimizer which already implements superblocks we show that atomic regions can suffer from severe performance penalties if misspeculations are left uncontrolled but that simple software control mechanism is sufficient to reign in all detrimental side effects we evaluate using full reference runs of the spec cpu integer benchmarks and find that atomic regions enable up to on average improvement beyond the performance of tuned product these performance improvements are achieved without any negative side effects performance side effects such as code bloat are absent with atomic regions in fact static code size is reduced the hardware necessary is synergistic with other needs and was already available on the commercial product used in our evaluation finally the software complexity is minimal as single developer was able to incorporate atomic regions into sophisticated line code base in three months despite never having seen the translator source code beforehand

the primary business model behind web search is based on textual advertising where contextually relevant ads are displayed alongside search results we address the problem of selecting these ads so that they are both relevant to the queries and profitable to the search engine showing that optimizing ad relevance and revenue is not equivalent selecting the best ads that satisfy these constraints also naturally incurs high computational costs and time constraints can lead to reduced relevance and profitability we propose novel two stage approach which conducts most of the analysis ahead of time an offine preprocessing phase leverages additional knowledge that is impractical to use in real time and rewrites frequent queries in way that subsequently facilitates fast and accurate online matching empirical evaluation shows that our method optimized for relevance matches state of the art method while improving expected revenue when optimizing for revenue we see even more substantial improvements in expected revenue
modern web search engines use different strategies to improve the overall quality of their document rankings usually the strategy adopted involves the combination of multiple sources of relevance into single ranking this work proposes the use of evolutionary techniques to derive good evidence combination functions using three different sources of evidence of relevance the textual content of documents the reputation of documents extracted from the connectivity information available in the processed collection and the anchor text concatenation the combination functions discovered by our evolutionary strategies were tested using collection containing queries extracted from real nation wide search engine query log with over million documents the experiments performed indicate that our proposal is an effective and practical alternative for combining sources of evidence into single ranking we also show that different types of queries submitted to search engine can require different combination functions and that our proposal is useful for coping with such differences
we propose framework for integrating data from multiple relational sources into an xml document that both conforms to given dtd and satisfies predefined xml constraints the framework is based on specification language aig that extends dtd by associating element types with semantic attributes inherited and synthesized inspired by the corresponding notions from attribute grammars computing these attributes via parameterized sql queries over multiple data sources and incorporating xml keys and inclusion constraints the novelty of aig consists in semantic attributes and their dependency relations for controlling context dependent dtd directed construction of xml documents as well as for checking xml constraints in parallel with document generation we also present cost based optimization techniques for efficiently evaluating aigs including algorithms for merging queries and for scheduling queries on multiple data sources this provides new grammar based approach for data integration under both syntactic and semantic constraints
technology trends present new challenges for processor architectures and their instruction schedulers growing transistor density will increase the number of execution units on single chip and decreasing wire transmission speeds will cause long and variable on chip latencies these trends will severely limit the two dominant conventional architectures dynamic issue superscalars and static placement and issue vliws we present new execution model in which the hardware and static scheduler instead work cooperatively called static placement dynamic issue spdi this paper focuses on the static instruction scheduler for spdi we identify and explore three issues spdi schedulers must consider locality contention and depth of speculation we evaluate range of spdi scheduling algorithms executing on an explicit data graph execution edge architecture we find that surprisingly simple one achieves an average of instructions per cycle ipc for spec wide issue machine and is within of the performance without on chip latencies these results suggest that the compiler is effective at balancing on chip latency and parallelism and that the division of responsibilities between the compiler and the architecture is well suited to future systems
the operations and management activities of enterprises are mainly task based and knowledge intensive accordingly an important issue in deploying knowledge management systems is the provision of task relevant information codified knowledge to meet the information needs of knowledge workers during the execution of task codified knowledge extracted from previously executed tasks can provide valuable knowledge about conducting the task at hand current task and is valuable information source for constructing task profile that models worker's task needs ie information needs for the current task in this paper we propose novel task relevance assessment approach that evaluates the relevance of previous tasks in order to construct task profile for the current task the approach helps knowledge workers assess the relevance of previous tasks through linguistic evaluation and the collaboration of knowledge workers in addition applying relevance assessment to large number of tasks may create an excessive burden for workers thus we propose novel two phase relevance assessment method to help workers conduct relevance assessment effectively furthermore modified relevance feedback technique which is integrated with the task relevance assessment method is employed to derive the task profile for the task at hand consequently task based knowledge support can be enabled to provide knowledge workers with task relevant information based on task profiles empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach models workers task needs effectively and helps provide task relevant knowledge
some significant progress related to multidimensional data analysis has been achieved in the past few years including the design of fast algorithms for computing datacubes selecting some precomputed group bys to materialize and designing efficient storage structures for multidimensional data however little work has been carried out on multidimensional query optimization issues particularly the response time or evaluation cost for answering several related dimensional queries simultaneously is crucial to the olap applications recently zhao et al first exploited this problem by presenting three heuristic algorithms in this paper we first consider in detail two cases of the problem in which all the queries are either hash based star joins or index based star joins only in the case of the hash based star join we devise polynomial approximation algorithm which delivers plan whose evaluation cost is epsilon times the optimal where is the number of queries and epsilon is fixed constant with epsilon leq we also present an exponential algorithm which delivers plan with the optimal evaluation cost in the case of the index based star join we present heuristic algorithm which delivers plan whose evaluation cost is times the optimal and an exponential algorithm which delivers plan with the optimal evaluation cost we then consider general case in which both hash based star join and index based star join queries are included for this case we give possible improvement on the work of zhao et al based on an analysis of their solutions we also develop another heuristic and an exact algorithm for the problem we finally conduct performance study by implementing our algorithms the experimental results demonstrate that the solutions delivered for the restricted cases are always within two times of the optimal which confirms our theoretical upper bounds actually these experiments produce much better results than our theoretical estimates to the best of our knowledge this is the only development of polynomial algorithms for the first two cases which are able to deliver plans with deterministic performance guarantees in terms of the qualities of the plans generated the previous approaches including that of zdns may generate feasible plan for the problem in these two cases but they do not provide any performance guarantee ie the plans generated by their algorithms can be arbitrarily far from the optimal one
recently method for removing shadows from colour images was developed finlayson et al in ieee trans pattern anal mach intell that relies upon finding special direction in chromaticity feature space this invariant direction is that for which particular colour features when projected into produce greyscale image which is approximately invariant to intensity and colour of scene illumination thus shadows which are in essence particular type of lighting are greatly attenuated the main approach to finding this special angle is camera calibration colour target is imaged under many different lights and the direction that best makes colour patch images equal across illuminants is the invariant direction here we take different approach in this work instead of camera calibration we aim at finding the invariant direction from evidence in the colour image itself specifically we recognize that producing projection in the correct invariant direction will result in distribution of pixel values that have smaller entropy than projecting in the wrong direction the reason is that the correct projection results in probability distribution spike for pixels all the same except differing by the lighting that produced their observed rgb values and therefore lying along line with orientation equal to the invariant direction hence we seek that projection which produces type of intrinsic independent of lighting reflectance information only image by minimizing entropy and from there go on to remove shadows as previously to be able to develop an effective description of the entropy minimization task we go over to the quadratic entropy rather than shannon's definition replacing the observed pixels with kernel density probability distribution the quadratic entropy can be written as very simple formulation and can be evaluated using the efficient fast gauss transform the entropy written in this embodiment has the advantage that it is more insensitive to quantization than is the usual definition the resulting algorithm is quite reliable and the shadow removal step produces good shadow free colour image results whenever strong shadow edges are present in the image in most cases studied entropy has strong minimum for the invariant direction revealing new property of image formation
we investigate the relationship between symmetry reduction and inductive reasoning when applied to model checking networks of featured components popular reduction techniques for combatting state space explosion in model checking like abstraction and symmetry reduction can only be applied effectively when the natural symmetry of system is not destroyed during specification we introduce property which ensures this is preserved open symmetry we describe template based approach for the construction of open symmetric promela specifications of featured systems for certain systems safely featured parameterised systems our generated specifications are suitable for conversion to abstract specifications representing any size of network this enables feature interaction analysis to be carried out via model checking and induction for systems of any number of featured components in addition we show how for any balanced network of components by using graphical representation of the features and the process communication structure group of permutations of the underlying state space of the generated specification can be determined easily due to the open symmetry of our promela specifications this group of permutations can be used directly for symmetry reduced model checking the main contributions of this paper are an automatic method for developing open symmetric specifications which can be used for generic feature interaction analysis and the novel application of symmetry detection and reduction in the context of model checking featured networks we apply our techniques to well known example of featured network an email system

in this article we explore the syntactic and semantic properties of prepositions in the context of the semantic interpretation of nominal phrases and compounds we investigate the problem based on cross linguistic evidence from set of six languages english spanish italian french portuguese and romanian the focus on english and romance languages is well motivated most of the time english nominal phrases and compounds translate into constructions of the form in romance languages where the preposition may vary in ways that correlate with the semantics thus we present empirical observations on the distribution of nominal phrases and compounds and the distribution of their meanings on two different corpora based on two state of the art classification tag sets lauer's set of eight prepositions and our list of semantic relations mapping between the two tag sets is also provided furthermore given training set of english nominal phrases and compounds along with their translations in the five romance languages our algorithm automatically learns classification rules and applies them to unseen test instances for semantic interpretation experimental results are compared against two state of the art models reported in the literature
this paper investigates the data exchange problem among distributed independent sources it is based on previous works in in which declarative semantics for pp systems in this semantics only facts not making the local databases inconsistent are imported weak models and the preferred weak models are those in which peers import maximal sets of facts not violating integrity constraints the framework proposed in does not provide any mechanism to set priorities among mapping rules anyhow while collecting data it is quite natural for source peer to associate different degrees of reliability to the portion of data provided by its neighbor peers starting from this observation this paper enhances previous semantics by using priority levels among mapping rules in order to select the weak models containing maximum number of mapping atoms according to their importance we will call these weak models trusted weak models and we will show they can be computed as stable models of logic program with weak constraints
significant effort has been invested in developing expressive and flexible access control languages and systems however little has been done to evaluate these systems in practical situations with real users and few attempts have been made to discover and analyze the access control policies that users actually want to implement we report on user study in which we derive the ideal access policies desired by group of users for physical security in an office environment we compare these ideal policies to the policies the users actually implemented with keys and with smartphone based distributed access control system we develop methodology that allows us to show quantitatively that the smartphone system allowed our users to implement their ideal policies more accurately and securely than they could with keys and we describe where each system fell short
location based routing lbr is one of the most widely used routing strategies in large scale wireless sensor networks with lbr small cheap and resource constrained nodes can perform the routing function without the need of complex computations and large amounts of memory space further nodes do not need to send energy consuming periodic advertisements because routing tables in the traditional sense are not needed one important assumption made by most lbr protocols is the availability of location service or mechanism to find other nodes positions although several mechanisms exist most of them rely on some sort of flooding procedure unsuitable for large scale wireless sensor networks especially with multiple and moving sinks and sources in this paper we introduce the anchor location service als protocol grid based protocol that provides sink location information in scalable and efficient manner and therefore supports location based routing in large scale wireless sensor networks the location service is evaluated mathematically and by simulations and also compared with well known grid based routing protocol our results demonstrate that als not only provides an efficient and scalable location service but also reduces the message overhead and the state complexity in scenarios with multiple and moving sinks and sources which are not usually included in the literature
ontology mapping is mandatory requirement for enabling semantic interoperability among different agents and services relying on different ontologies this aspect becomes more critical in peer to peer pp networks for several reasons the number of different ontologies can dramatically increase ii mappings among peer ontologies have to be discovered on the fly and only on the parts of ontologies contextual to specific interaction in which peers are involved iii complex mapping strategies eg structural mapping based on graph matching cannot be exploited since peers are not aware of one another's ontologies in order to address these issues we developed new ontology mapping algorithm called semantic coordinator secco secco is composed by three individual matchers syntactic lexical and contextual the syntactic matcher in order to discover mappings exploits different kinds of linguistic information eg comments labels encoded in ontology entities the lexical matcher enables discovering mappings in semantic way since it interprets the semantic meaning of concepts to be compared the contextual matcher relies on how it fits strategy inspired by the contextual theory of meaning and by taking into account the contexts in which the concepts to be compared are used refines similarity values we show through experimental results that secco fulfills two important requirements fastness and accuracy ie quality of mappings secco differently from other semantic pp applications eg piazza gridvine that assume the preexistence of mappings for achieving semantic interoperability focuses on the problem of finding mappings therefore if coupled with pp platform it paves the way towards comprehensive semantic pp solution for content sharing and retrieval semantic query answering and query routing we report on the advantages of integrating secco in the link system
in this paper we develop an automatic wrapper for the extraction of multiple sections data records from search engine results pages in the information extraction world less attention has been focused on the development of wrappers for the extraction of multiple sections data records this is evidenced by the fact that there is only one automatic wrapper mse developed for this purpose using the separation distance of data records and sections mse is able to distinguish sections and data records and extract them from search engine results pages in this study our approach is the use of dom tree properties to develop an adaptive search method which is able to detect differentiate and partition sections and data records the multiple sections data records labeled are used to pass through few filtering stages each filter is designed to filter out particular group of irrelevant data until one data region containing the relevant records is found our filtering rules are designed based on visual cue such as text and image size obtained from the browser rendering engine experimental results show that our wrapper is able to obtain better results than the currently available mse wrapper
discovery of sequential patterns is an essential data mining task with broad applications among several variations of sequential patterns closed sequential pattern is the most useful one since it retains all the information of the complete pattern set but is often much more compact than it unfortunately there is no parallel closed sequential pattern mining method proposed yet in this paper we develop an algorithm called par csp parallel closed sequential pattern mining to conduct parallel mining of closed sequential patterns on distributed memory system par csp partitions the work among the processors by exploiting the divide and conquer property so that the overhead of interprocessor communication is minimized par csp applies dynamic scheduling to avoid processor idling moreover it employs technique called selective sampling to address the load imbalance problem we implement par csp using mpi on node linux cluster our experimental results show that par csp attains good parallelization efficiencies on various input datasets
spearman's footrule and kendall's tau are two well established distances between rankings they however fail to take into account concepts crucial to evaluating result set in information retrieval element relevance and positional information that is changing the rank of highly relevant document should result in higher penalty than changing the rank of an irrelevant document similar logic holds for the top versus the bottom of the result ordering in this work we extend both of these metrics to those with position and element weights and show that variant of the diaconis graham inequality still holds the generalized two measures remain within constant factor of each other for all permutations we continue by extending the element weights into distance metric between elements for example in search evaluation swapping the order of two nearly duplicate results should result in little penalty even if these two are highly relevant and appear at the top of the list we extend the distance measures to this more general case and show that they remain within constant factor of each other we conclude by conducting simple experiments on web search data with the proposed measures our experiments show that the weighted generalizations are more robust and consistent with each other than their unweighted counter parts
we propose new approach for constructing pp networks based on dynamic decomposition of continuous space into cells corresponding to servers we demonstrate the power of this approach by suggesting two new pp architectures and various algorithms for them the first serves as dht distributed hash table and the other is dynamic expander network the dht network which we call distance halving allows logarithmic routing and load while preserving constant degrees it offers an optimal tradeoff between degree and path length in the sense that degree guarantees path length of logd another advantage over previous constructions is its relative simplicity major new contribution of this construction is dynamic caching technique that maintains low load and storage even under the occurrence of hot spots our second construction builds network that is guaranteed to be an expander the resulting topologies are simple to maintain and implement their simplicity makes it easy to modify and add protocols small variation yields dht which is robust against random byzantine faults finally we show that using our approach it is possible to construct any family of constant degree graphs in dynamic environment though with worse parameters therefore we expect that more distributed data structures could be designed and implemented in dynamic environment
wormhole attack is particularly harmful against routing in sensor networks where an attacker receives packets at one location in the network tunnels and then replays them at another remote location in the network wormhole attack can be easily launched by an attacker without compromising any sensor nodes since most of the routing protocols do not have mechanisms to defend the network against wormhole attacks the route request can be tunneled to the target area by the attacker through wormholes thus the sensor nodes in the target area build the route through the attacker later the attacker can tamper the data messages or selectively forward data messages to disrupt the functions of the sensor network researchers have used some special hardware such as the directional antenna and the precise synchronized clock to defend the sensor network against wormhole attacks during the neighbor discovery process in this paper we propose secure routing protocol against wormhole attacks in sensor networks serwa serwa protocol avoids using any special hardware such as the directional antenna and the precise synchronized clock to detect wormhole moreover it provides real secure route against the wormhole attack simulation results show that serwa protocol only has very small false positives for wormhole detection during the neighbor discovery process less than the average energy usage at each node for serwa protocol during the neighbor discovery and route discovery is below mj which is much lower than the available energy kj at each node the cost analysis shows that serwa protocol only needs small memory usage at each node below kb if each node has neighbors which is suitable for the sensor network
exception handling mechanisms are intended to support the development of robust software however the implementation of such mechanisms with aspect oriented ao programming might lead to error prone scenarios as aspects extend or replace existing functionality at specific join points in the code execution aspects behavior may bring new exceptions which can flow through the program execution in unexpected ways this paper presents systematic study that assesses the error proneness of aop mechanisms on exception flows of evolving programs the analysis was based on the object oriented and the aspect oriented versions of three medium sized systems from different application domains our findings show that exception handling code in ao systems is error prone since all versions analyzed presented an increase in the number of uncaught exceptions and exceptions caught by the wrong handler the causes of such problems are characterized and presented as catalogue of bug patterns
service oriented systems are constructed using web services as first class programmable units and subsystems and there have been many successful applications of such systems however there is major unresolved problem with the software development and subsequent management of these applications and systems web service interfaces and implementations may be developed and changed autonomously which makes traditional configuration management practices inadequate for web services checking the compatibility of these programmable units turns out to be difficult task in this paper we present technique for checking compatibility of web service interfaces and implementations based on categorizing domain ontology instances of service description documents this technique is capable of both assessing the compatibility and identifying incompatibility factors of service interfaces and implementations the design details of system model for web service compatibility checking and the key operator for evaluating compatibility within the model are discussed we present simulation experiments and analyze the results to show the effectiveness and performance variations of our technique with different data source patterns
in this paper we are interested in minimizing the delay and maximizing the lifetime of event driven wireless sensor networks for which events occur infrequently in such systems most of the energy is consumed when the radios are on waiting for packet to arrive sleep wake scheduling is an effective mechanism to prolong the lifetime of these energy constrained wireless sensor networks however sleep wake scheduling could result in substantial delays because transmitting node needs to wait for its next hop relay node to wake up an interesting line of work attempts to reduce these delays by developing anycast based packet forwarding schemes where each node opportunistically forwards packet to the first neighboring node that wakes up among multiple candidate nodes in this paper we first study how to optimize the anycast forwarding schemes for minimizing the expected packet delivery delays from the sensor nodes to the sink based on this result we then provide solution to the joint control problem of how to optimally control the system parameters of the sleep wake scheduling protocol and the anycast packet forwarding protocol to maximize the network lifetime subject to constraint on the expected end to end packet delivery delay our numerical results indicate that the proposed solution can outperform prior heuristic solutions in the literature especially under practical scenarios where there are obstructions eg lake or mountain in the coverage area of the wireless sensor network
in this paper we propose sharpness dependent filter design based on the fairing of surface normal whereby the filtering algorithm automatically selects filter this may be mean filter min filter or filter ranked between these two depending on the local sharpness value and the sharpness dependent weighting function selected to recover the original shape of noisy model the algorithm selects mean filter for flat regions and min filter for distinguished sharp regions the selected sharpness dependent weighting function has gaussian laplacian or el fallah ford form that approximately fits the sharpness distribution found in all tested noisy models we use sharpness factor in the weighting function to control the degree of feature preserving the appropriate sharpness factor can be obtained by sharpness analysis based on the bayesian classification our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed sharpness dependent filter is superior to other approaches for smoothing polygon mesh as well as for preserving its sharp features
singleton kinds provide an elegant device for expressing type equality information resulting from modern module languages but they can complicate the metatheory of languages in which they appear present translation from language with singleton kinds to one without and prove this translation to be sound and complete this translation is useful for type preserving compilers generating typed target languages the proof of soundness and completeness is done by normalizing type equivalence derivations using stone and harper's type equivalence decision procedure

policies in modern systems and applications play an essential role we argue that decisions based on policy rules should take into account the possibility for the users to enable specific policy rules by performing actions at the time when decisions are being rendered and or by promising to perform other actions in the future decisions should also consider preferences among different sets of actions enabling different rules we adopt formalism and mechanism devised for policy rule management in this context and investigate in detail the notion of obligations which are those actions users promise to perform in the future upon firing of specific policy rule we also investigate how obligations can be monitored and how the policy rules should be affected when obligations are either fulfilled or defaulted
vision based human action recognition provides an advanced interface and research in the field of human action recognition has been actively carried out however an environment from dynamic viewpoint where we can be in any position any direction etc must be considered in our living space in order to overcome the viewpoint dependency we propose volume motion template vmt and projected motion template pmt the proposed vmt method is an extension of the motion history image mhi method to space the pmt is generated by projecting the vmt into plane that is orthogonal to an optimal virtual viewpoint where the optimal virtual viewpoint is viewpoint from which an action can be described in greatest detail in space from the proposed method any actions taken from different viewpoints can be recognized independent of the viewpoints the experimental results demonstrate the accuracies and effectiveness of the proposed vmt method for view independent human action recognition
in blaze bleumer and strauss bbs proposed an application called atomic proxy re encryption in which semitrusted proxy converts ciphertext for alice into ciphertext for bob without seeing the underlying plaintext we predict that fast and secure re encryption will become increasingly popular as method for managing encrypted file systems although efficiently computable the wide spread adoption of bbs re encryption has been hindered by considerable security risks following recent work of dodis and ivan we present new re encryption schemes that realize stronger notion of security and demonstrate the usefulness of proxy re encryption as method of adding access control to secure file system performance measurements of our experimental file system demonstrate that proxy re encryption can work effectively in practice
advances in biological experiments such as dna microarrays have produced large multidimensional data sets for examination and retrospective analysis scientists however heavily rely on existing biomedical knowledge in order to fully analyze and comprehend such datasets our proposed framework relies on the gene ontology for integrating priori biomedical knowledge into traditional data analysis approaches we explore the impact of considering each aspect of the gene ontology individually for quantifying the biological relatedness between gene products we discuss two figure of merit scores for quantifying the pair wise biological relatedness between gene products and the intra cluster biological coherency of groups of gene products finally we perform cluster deterioration simulation experiments on well scrutinized saccharomyces cerevisiae data set consisting of hybridization measurements the results presented illustrate strong correlation between the devised cluster coherency figure of merit and the randomization of cluster membership

we apply an extension of the nelson oppen combination method to develop decision procedure for the non disjoint union of theories modeling data structures with counting operator and fragments of arithmetic we present some data structures and some fragments of arithmetic for which the combination method is complete and effective to achieve effectiveness the combination method relies on particular procedures to compute sets that are representative of all the consequences over the shared theory we show how to compute these sets by using superposition calculus for the theories of the considered data structures and various solving and reduction techniques for the fragments of arithmetic we are interested in including gauss elimination fourier motzkin elimination and groebner bases computation
we present the first to our knowledge approximation algorithm for tensor clustering powerful generalization to basic clustering tensors are increasingly common in modern applications dealing with complex heterogeneous data and clustering them is fundamental tool for data analysis and pattern discovery akin to their cousins common tensor clustering formulations are np hard to optimize but unlike the case no approximation algorithms seem to be known we address this imbalance and build on recent co clustering work to derive tensor clustering algorithm with approximation guarantees allowing metrics and divergences eg bregman as objective functions therewith we answer two open questions by anagnostopoulos et al our analysis yields constant approximation factor independent of data size worst case example shows this factor to be tight for euclidean co clustering however empirically the approximation factor is observed to be conservative so our method can also be used in practice
many multicast overlay networks maintain application specific performance goals by dynamically adapting the overlay structure when the monitored performance becomes inadequate this adaptation results in an unstructured overlay where no neighbor selection constraints are imposed although such networks provide resilience to benign failures they are susceptible to attacks conducted by adversaries that compromise overlay nodes previous defense solutions proposed to address attacks against overlay networks rely on strong organizational constraints and are not effective for unstructured overlays in this work we identify demonstrate and mitigate insider attacks against measurement based adaptation mechanisms in unstructured multicast overlay networks we propose techniques to decrease the number of incorrect adaptations by using outlier detection and limit the impact of malicious nodes by aggregating local information to derive global reputation for each node we demonstrate the attacks and mitigation techniques through real life deployments of mature overlay multicast system
due to the rapid development in mobile communication technologies the usage of mobile devices such as cell phone or pda has increased significantly as different devices require different applications various new services are being developed to satisfy the needs one of the popular services under heavy demand is the location based service lbs that exploits the spatial information of moving objects per temporal changes in order to support lbs well in this paper we investigate how spatio temporal information of moving objects can be efficiently stored and indexed in particular we propose novel location encoding method based on hierarchical administrative district information our proposal is different from conventional approaches where moving objects are often expressed as geometric points in two dimensional space instead in ours moving objects are encoded as one dimensional points by both administrative district as well as road information our method becomes especially useful for monitoring traffic situation or tracing location of moving objects through approximate spatial queries
as current trends in software development move toward more complex object oriented programming inlining has become vital optimization that provides substantial performance improvements to and java programs yet the aggressiveness of the inlining algorithm must be carefully monitored to effectively balance performance and code size the state of the art is to use profile information associated with call edges to guide inlining decisions in the presence of virtual method calls profile information for one call edge may not be sufficient for making effectual inlining decisions therefore we explore the use of profiling data with additional levels of context sensitivity in addition to exploring fixed levels of context sensitivity we explore several adaptive schemes that attempt to find the ideal degree of context sensitivity for each call site our techniques are evaluated on the basis of runtime performance code size and dynamic compilation time on average we found that with minimal impact on performance context sensitivity can enable reductions in compiled code space and compile time performance on individual programs varied from minus to while reductions in compile time and code space of up to and respectively were obtained
suffix trees are by far the most important data structure in stringology with myriads of applications in fields like bioinformatics and information retrieval classical representations of suffix trees require log bits of space for string of size this is considerably more than the log bits needed for the string itself where is the alphabet size the size of suffix trees has been barrier to their wider adoption in practice recent compressed suffix tree representations require just the space of the compressed string plus extra bits this is already spectacular but still unsatisfactory when is small as in dna sequences in this paper we introduce the first compressed suffix tree representation that breaks this linear space barrier our representation requires sublinear extra space and supports large set of navigational operations in logarithmic time an essential ingredient of our representation is the lowest common ancestor lca query we reveal important connections between lca queries and suffix tree navigation
approximation algorithms for clustering points in metric spaces is flourishing area of research with much research effort spent on getting better understanding of the approximation guarantees possible for many objective functions such as median means and min sum clustering this quest for better approximation algorithms is further fueled by the implicit hope that these better approximations also yield more accurate clusterings eg for many problems such as clustering proteins by function or clustering images by subject there is some unknown correct target clustering and the implicit hope is that approximately optimizing these objective functions will in fact produce clustering that is close pointwise to the truth in this paper we show that if we make this implicit assumption explicit that is if we assume that any approximation to the given clustering objective phi is epsilon close to the target then we can produce clusterings that are epsilon close to the target even for values for which obtaining approximation is np hard in particular for median and means objectives we show that we can achieve this guarantee for any constant and for the min sum objective we can do this for any constant our results also highlight surprising conceptual difference between assuming that the optimal solution to say the median objective is epsilon close to the target and assuming that any approximately optimal solution is epsilon close to the target even for approximation factor say in the former case the problem of finding solution that is epsilon close to the target remains computationally hard and yet for the latter we have an efficient algorithm
decoupled software pipelining dswp is one approach to automatically extract threads from loops it partitions loops into long running threads that communicate in pipelined manner via inter core queues this work recognizes that dswp can also be an enabling transformation for other loop parallelization techniques this use of dswp called dswp splits loop into new loops with dependence patterns amenable to parallelization using techniques that were originally either inapplicable or poorly performing by parallelizing each stage of the dswp pipeline using potentially different techniques not only is the benefit of dswp increased but the applicability and performance of other parallelization techniques are enhanced this paper evaluates dswp as an enabling framework for other transformations by applying it in conjunction with doall localwrite and specdoall to individual stages of the pipeline this paper demonstrates significant performance gains on commodity core multicore machine running variety of codes transformed with dswp
insufficiency of labeled training data is major obstacle for automatic video annotation semi supervised learning is an effective approach to this problem by leveraging large amount of unlabeled data however existing semi supervised learning algorithms have not demonstrated promising results in large scale video annotation due to several difficulties such as large variation of video content and intractable computational cost in this paper we propose novel semi supervised learning algorithm named semi supervised kernel density estimation sskde which is developed based on kernel density estimation kde approach while only labeled data are utilized in classical kde in sskde both labeled and unlabeled data are leveraged to estimate class conditional probability densities based on an extended form of kde it is non parametric method and it thus naturally avoids the model assumption problem that exists in many parametric semi supervised methods meanwhile it can be implemented with an efficient iterative solution process so this method is appropriate for video annotation furthermore motivated by existing adaptive kde approach we propose an improved algorithm named semi supervised adaptive kernel density estimation ssakde it employs local adaptive kernels rather than fixed kernel such that broader kernels can be applied in the regions with low density in this way more accurate density estimates can be obtained extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methods
acquiring models of intricate objects like tree branches bicycles and insects is challenging task due to severe self occlusions repeated thin structures and surface discontinuities in theory shape from silhouettes sfs approach can overcome these difficulties and reconstruct visual hulls that are close to the actual shapes regardless of the complexity of the object in practice however sfs is highly sensitive to errors in silhouette contours and the calibration of the imaging system and has therefore not been used for obtaining accurate shapes with large number of views in this work we present practical approach to sfs using novel technique called coplanar shadowgram imaging that allows us to use dozens to even hundreds of views for visual hull reconstruction point light source is moved around an object and the shadows silhouettes cast onto single background plane are imaged we characterize this imaging system in terms of image projection reconstruction ambiguity epipolar geometry and shape and source recovery the coplanarity of the shadowgrams yields unique geometric properties that are not possible in traditional multi view camera based imaging systems these properties allow us to derive robust and automatic algorithm to recover the visual hull of an object and the positions of the light source simultaneously regardless of the complexity of the object we demonstrate the acquisition of several intricate shapes with severe occlusions and thin structures using to views
the unix fast file system ffs is probably the most widely used file system for performance comparisons however such comparisons frequently overlook many of the performance enhancements that have been added over the past decade in this paper we explore the two most commonly used approaches for improving the performance of meta data operations and recovery journaling and soft updates journaling systems use an auxiliary log to record meta data operations and soft updates uses ordered writes to ensure metadata consistency the commercial sector has moved en masse to journaling file systems as evidenced by their presence on nearly every server platform available today solaris aix digital unix hp ux irix and windows nt on all but solaris the default file system uses journaling in the meantime soft updates holds the promise of providing stronger reliability guarantees than journaling with faster recovery and superior performance in certain boundary cases in this paper we explore the benefits of soft updates and journaling comparing their behavior on both microbenchmarks and workload based macrobenchmarks we find that journaling alone is not sufficient to solve the meta data update problem if synchronous semantics are required ie meta data operations are durable once the system call returns then the journaling systems cannot realize their full potential only when this synchronicity requirement is relaxed can journaling systems approach the performance of systems like soft updates which also relaxes this requirement our asynchronous journaling and soft updates systems perform comparably in most cases while soft updates excels in some meta data intensive microbenchmarks the macrobenchmark results are more ambiguous in three cases soft updates and journaling are comparable in file intensive news workload journaling prevails and in small isp workload soft updates prevails
currently there are no known explicit algorithms for the great majority of graph problems in the dynamic distributed message passing model instead most state of the art dynamic distributed algorithms are constructed by composing static algorithm for the problem at hand with simulation technique that converts static algorithms to dynamic ones we argue that this powerful methodology does not provide satisfactory solutions for many important dynamic distributed problems and this necessitates developing algorithms for these problems from scratch in this paper we develop fully dynamic distributed algorithm for maintaining sparse spanners our algorithm improves drastically the quiescence time of the state of the art algorithm for the problem moreover we show that the quiescence time of our algorithm is optimal up to small constant factor in addition our algorithm improves significantly upon the state of the art algorithm in all efficiency parameters specifically it has smaller quiescence message and space complexities and smaller local processing time finally our algorithm is self contained and fairly simple and is consequently amenable to implementation on unsophisticated network devices

adaptive object models aom are sophisticated way of building object oriented systems that let non programmers customize the behavior of the system and that are most useful for businesses that are rapidly changing although systems based on an aom are often much smaller than competitors they can be difficult to build and to learn we believe that the problems with aom are due in part to mismatch between their design and the languages that are used to build them this paper describes how to avoid this mismatch by using implicit and explicit metaclasses
this paper proposes using user level memory thread ulmt for correlation prefetching in this approach user thread runs on general purpose processor in main memory either in the memory controller chip or in dram chip the thread performs correlation prefetching in software sending the prefetched data into the cache of the main processor this approach requires minimal hardware beyond the memory processor the correlation table is software data structure that resides in main memory while the main processor only needs few modifications to its cache so that it can accept incoming prefetches in addition the approach has wide applicability as it can effectively prefetch even for irregular applications finally it is very flexible as the prefetching algorithm can be customized by the user on an application basis our simulation results show that through new design of the correlation table and prefetching algorithm our scheme delivers good results specifically nine mostly irregular applications show an average speedup of furthermore our scheme works well in combination with conventional processor side sequential prefetcher in which case the average speedup increases to finally by exploiting the customization of the prefetching algorithm we increase the average speedup to

the replica placement problem rpp aims at creating set of duplicated data objects across the nodes of distributed system in order to optimize certain criteria typically rpp formulations fall into two categories static and dynamic the first assumes that access statistics are estimated in advance and remain static and therefore one time replica distribution is sufficient irpp in contrast dynamic methods change the replicas in the network potentially upon every request this paper proposes an alternative technique named continuous replica placement problem crpp which falls between the two extreme approaches crpp can be defined as given an already implemented replication scheme and estimated access statistics for the next time period define new replication scheme subject to optimization criteria and constraints as we show in the problem formulation crpp is different in that the existing heuristics in the literature cannot be used either statically or dynamically to solve the problem in fact even with the most careful design their performance will be inferior since crpp embeds scheduling problem to facilitate the proposed mechanism we provide insight on the intricacies of crpp and propose various heuristics
software classification models have been regarded as an essential support tool in performing measurement and analysis processes most of the established models are single cycled in the model usage stage and thus require the measurement data of all the model's variables to be simultaneously collected and utilized for classifying an unseen case within only single decision cycle conversely the multi cycled model allows the measurement data of all the model's variables to be gradually collected and utilized for such classification within more than one decision cycle and thus intuitively seems to have better classification efficiency but poorer classification accuracy software project managers often have difficulties in choosing an appropriate classification model that is better suited to their specific environments and needs however this important topic is not adequately explored in software measurement and analysis literature by using an industrial software measurement dataset of nasa kc this paper explores the quantitative performance comparisons of the classification accuracy and efficiency of the discriminant analysis da and logistic regression lr based single cycled models and the decision tree dt based and echaid algorithms multi cycled models the experimental results suggest that the re appraisal cost of the type mr the software failure cost of type ii mr and the data collection cost of software measurements should be considered simultaneously when choosing an appropriate classification model
cyber physical systems increasingly rely on dynamically adaptive programs to respond to changes in their physical environment examples include ecosystem monitoring and disaster relief systems these systems are considered high assurance since errors during execution could result in injury loss of life environmental impact and or financial loss in order to facilitate the development and verification of dynamically adaptive systems we separate functional concerns from adaptive concerns specifically we model dynamically adaptive program as collection of non adaptive steady state programs and set of adaptations that realize transitions among steady state programs in response to environmental changes we use linear temporal logic ltl to specify properties of the non adaptive portions of the system and we use ltl an adapt operator extension toltl to concisely specify properties that hold during the adaptation process model checking offers an attractive approach to automatically analyzing models for adherence to formal properties and thus providing assurance however currently model checkers are unable to verify properties specified using ltl moreover as the number of steady state programs and adaptations increase the verification costs in terms of space and time potentially become unwieldy to address these issues we propose modular model checking approach to verifying that formal model of an adaptive program satisfies its requirements specified in ltl and ltl respectively
as the size of an rfid tag becomes smaller and the price of the tag gets lower rfid technology has been applied to wide range of areas recently rfid has been adopted in the business area such as supply chain management since companies can get movement information for products easily using the rfid technology it is expected to revolutionize supply chain management however the amount of rfid data in supply chain management is huge therefore it requires much time to extract valuable information from rfid data for supply chain management in this paper we define query templates for tracking queries and path oriented queries to analyze the supply chain we then propose an effective path encoding scheme to encode the flow information for products to retrieve the time information for products efficiently we utilize numbering scheme used in the xml area based on the path encoding scheme and the numbering scheme we devise storage scheme to process tracking queries and path oriented queries efficiently finally we propose method which translates the queries to sql queries experimental results show that our approach can process the queries efficiently on the average our approach is about times better than recent technique in terms of query performance
we review two areas of recent research linking proportional fairness with product form networks the areas concern respectively the heavy traffic and the large deviations limiting regimes for the stationary distribution of flow model where the flow model is stochastic process representing the randomly varying number of document transfers present in network sharing capacity according to the proportional fairness criterion in these two regimes we postulate the limiting form of the stationary distribution by comparison with several variants of the fairness criterion we outline how product form results can help provide insight into the performance consequences of resource pooling
large scale supercomputing is revolutionizing the way science is conducted growing challenge however is understanding the massive quantities of data produced by large scale simulations the data typically time varying multivariate and volumetric can occupy from hundreds of gigabytes to several terabytes of storage space transferring and processing volume data of such sizes is prohibitively expensive and resource intensive although it may not be possible to entirely alleviate these problems data compression should be considered as part of viable solution especially when the primary means of data analysis is volume rendering in this paper we present our study of multivariate compression which exploits correlations among related variables for volume rendering two configurations for multidimensional compression based on vector quantization are examined we emphasize quality reconstruction and interactive rendering which leads us to solution using graphics hardware to perform on the fly decompression during rendering
abstract in this paper we extend the standard for object oriented databases odmg with reactive features by proposing language for specifying triggers and defining its semantics this extension has several implications thus this work makes three different specific contributions first the definition of declarative data manipulation language for odmg which is missing in the current version of the standard such definition requires revisiting data manipulation in odmg and also addressing issues related to set oriented versus instance oriented computation then the definition of trigger language for odmg unifying also the sql proposal and providing support for trigger inheritance and overriding finally the development of formal semantics for the proposed data manipulation and trigger languages
most future large scale sensor networks are expected to follow two tier architecture which consists of resource rich master nodes at the upper tier and resource poor sensor nodes at the lower tier sensor nodes submit data to nearby master nodes which then answer the queries from the network owner on behalf of sensor nodes relying on master nodes for data storage and query processing raises severe concerns about data confidentiality and query result correctness when the sensor network is deployed in hostile environments in particular compromised master node may leak hosted sensitive data to the adversary it may also return juggled or incomplete query results to the network owner this paper for the first time in the literature presents suite of novel schemes to secure multidimensional range queries in tiered sensor networks the proposed schemes can ensure data confidentiality against master nodes and also enable the network owner to verify with very high probability the authenticity and completeness of any query result by inspecting the spatial and temporal relationships among the returned data detailed performance evaluations confirm the high efficacy and efficiency of the proposed schemes
applications ranging from location based services to multi player online gaming require continuous query support to monitor track and detect events of interest among sets of moving objects examples are alerting capabilities for detecting whether the distance the travel cost or the travel time among set of moving objects exceeds threshold these types of queries are driven by continuous streams of location updates simultaneously evaluated over many queries in this paper we define three types of proximity relations that induce location constraints to model continuous spatio temporal queries among sets of moving objects in road networks our focus lies on evaluating large number of continuous queries simultaneously we introduce novel moving object indexing technique that together with novel road network partitioning scheme restricts computations within the partial road network these techniques reduce query processing overhead by more than experiments over real world data sets show that our approach is twenty times faster than baseline algorithm

the technique of latent semantic indexing is used in wide variety of commercial applications in these applications the processing time and ram required for svd computation and the processing time and ram required during lsi retrieval operations are all roughly linear in the number of dimensions chosen for the lsi representation space in large scale commercial lsi applications reducing values could be of significant value in reducing server costs this paper explores the effects of varying dimensionality the approach taken here focuses on term comparisons pairs of terms are considered which have strong real world associations the proximities of members of these pairs in the lsi space are compared at multiple values of the testing is carried out for collections of from one to five million documents for the five million document collection value of provides the best performance the results suggest that there is something of an island of stability in the to range the results also indicate that there is relatively little room to employ values outside of this range without incurring significant distortions in at least some term term correlations
traditional content based image retrieval systems typically compute single descriptor per image based for example on color histograms the result of query is in general the images from the database whose descriptors are the closest to the descriptor of the query image systems built this way are able to return images that are globally similar to the query image but can not return images that contain some of the objects that are in the query as opposed to this traditional coarse grain recognition scheme recent advances in image processing make fine grain image recognition possible notably by computing local descriptors that can detect similar objects in different images obviously powerful fine grain recognition in images also changes the retrieval process instead of submitting single query to retrieve similar images multiple queries must be submitted and their partial results must be post processed before delivering the answer this paper first presents family of local descriptors supporting fine grain image recognition these descriptors enforce robust recognition despite image rotations and translations illumination variations and partial occlusions many multi dimensional indexes have been proposed to speed up the retrieval process these indexes however have been mostly designed for and evaluated against databases where each image is described by single descriptor while this paper does not present any new indexing scheme it shows that the three most efficient indexing techniques known today are still too slow to be used in practice with local descriptors because of the changes in the retrieval process
the advance of the web has significantly and rapidly changed the way of information organization sharing and distribution the next generation of the web the semantic web seeks to make information more usable by machines by introducing more rigorous structure based on ontologies in this context we try to propose novel and integrated approach for semi automated extraction of ontology based semantic web from data intensive web application and thus make the web content machine understandable our approach is based on the idea that semantics can be extracted by applying reverse engineering technique on the structures and the instances of html forms which are the most convenient interface to communicate with relational databases on the current data intensive web application this semantics is exploited to produce over several steps personalised ontology
we consider the problem of flow coordination in distributed multimedia applications most transport level protocols are designed to operate independently and lack mechanisms for sharing information with other flows and coordinating data transport in various ways this limitation becomes problematic in distributed applications that employ numerous flows between two computing clusters sharing the same intermediary forwarding path across the internet in this article we propose an open architecture that supports the sharing of network state information peer flow information and application specific information called simply the coordination protocol cp the scheme facilitates coordination of network resource usage across flows belonging to the same application as well as aiding other types of coordination the effectiveness of our approach is illustrated in the context of multistreaming in tele immersion where consistency of network information across flows both greatly improves frame transport synchrony and minimizes buffering delay
nodes in the hexagonal mesh and torus network are placed at the vertices of regular triangular tessellation so that each node has up to six neighbors the routing algorithm for the hexagonal torus is very complicated and it is an open problem by now hexagonal mesh and torus are known to belong to the class of cayley digraphs in this paper we use cayley formulations for the hexagonal torus along with some result on subgraphs and coset graphs to develop the optimal routing algorithm for the hexagonal torus and then we draw conclusions to the network diameter of the hexagonal torus

in the sponsored search model search engines are paid by businesses that are interested in displaying ads for their site alongside the search results businesses bid for keywords and their ad is displayed when the keyword is queried to the search engine an important problem in this process is keyword generation given business that is interested in launching campaign suggest keywords that are related to that campaign we address this problem by making use of the query logs of the search engine we identify queries related to campaign by exploiting the associations between queries and urls as they are captured by the user's clicks these queries form good keyword suggestions since they capture the wisdom of the crowd as to what is related to site we formulate the problem as semi supervised learning problem and propose algorithms within the markov random field model we perform experiments with real query logs and we demonstrate that our algorithms scale to large query logs and produce meaningful results
tracked objects rarely move alone they are often temporarily accompanied by other objects undergoing similar motion we propose novel tracking algorithm called sputnik tracker it is capable of identifying which image regions move coherently with the tracked object this information is used to stabilize tracking in the presence of occlusions or fluctuations in the appearance of the tracked object without the need to model its dynamics in addition sputnik tracker is based on novel template tracker integrating foreground and background appearance cues the time varying shape of the target is also estimated in each video frame together with the target position the time varying shape is used as another cue when estimating the target position in the next frame

relatively small set of static instructions has significant leverage on program execution performance these problem instructions contribute disproportionate number of cache misses and branch mispredictions because their behavior cannot be accurately anticipated using existing prefetching or branch prediction mechanisms the behavior of many problem instructions can be predicted by executing small code fragment called speculative slice if speculative slice is executed before the corresponding problem instructions are fetched then the problem instructions can move smoothly through the pipeline because the slice has tolerated the latency of the memory hierarchy for loads or the pipeline for branches this technique results in speedups up to percent over an aggressive baseline machine to benefit from branch predictions generated by speculative slices the predictions must be bound to specific dynamic branch instances we present technique that invalidates predictions when it can be determined by monitoring the program's execution path that they will not be used this enables the remaining predictions to be correctly correlated
for any outsourcing service privacy is major concern this paper focuses on outsourcing frequent itemset mining and examines the issue on how to protect privacy against the case where the attackers have precise knowledge on the supports of some items we propose new approach referred to as support anonymity to protect each sensitive item with other items of similar support to achieve support anonymity we introduce pseudo taxonomy tree and have the third party mine the generalized frequent itemsets under the corresponding generalized association rules instead of association rules the pseudo taxonomy is construct to facilitate hiding of the original items where each original item can map to either leaf node or an internal node in the taxonomy tree the rationale for this approach is that with taxonomy tree the nodes to satisfy the support anonymity may be any nodes in the taxonomy tree with the appropriate supports so this approach can provide more candidates for support anonymity with limited fake items as only the leaf nodes not the internal nodes of the taxonomy tree need to appear in the transactions otherwise for the association rule mining the nodes to satisfy the support anonymity have to correspond to the leaf nodes in the taxonomy tree this is far more restricted the challenge is thus on how to generate the pseudo taxonomy tree to facilitate support anonymity and to ensure the conservation of original frequent itemsets the experimental results showed that our methods of support anonymity can achieve very good privacy protection with moderate storage overhead
topical crawlers are increasingly seen as way to address the scalability limitations of universal search engines by distributing the crawling process across users queries or even client computers the context available to such crawlers can guide the navigation of links with the goal of efficiently locating highly relevant target pages we developed framework to fairly evaluate topical crawling algorithms under number of performance metrics such framework is employed here to evaluate different algorithms that have proven highly competitive among those proposed in the literature and in our own previous research in particular we focus on the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation of the cues available to crawler and on adaptive crawlers that use machine learning techniques to guide their search we find that the best performance is achieved by novel combination of explorative and exploitative bias and introduce an evolutionary crawler that surpasses the performance of the best nonadaptive crawler after sufficiently long crawls we also analyze the computational complexity of the various crawlers and discuss how performance and complexity scale with available resources evolutionary crawlers achieve high efficiency and scalability by distributing the work across concurrent agents resulting in the best performance cost ratio

in order to manage service to meet the agreed upon sla it is important to design service of the required capacity and to monitor the service thereafter for violations at runtime this objective can be achieved by translating slos specified in the sla into lower level policies that can then be used for design and enforcement purposes such design and operational policies are often constraints on thresholds of lower level metrics in this paper we propose systematic and practical approach that combines fine grained performance modeling with regression analysis to translate service level objectives into design and operational policies for multi tier applications we demonstrate that our approach can handle both request based and session based workloads and deal with workload changes in terms of both request volume and transaction mix we validate our approach using both the rubis commerce benchmark and trace driven simulation of business critical enterprise application these results show the effectiveness of our approach
classical compiler optimizations assume fixed cache architecture and modify the program to take best advantage of it in some cases this may not be the best strategy because each nest might work best with different cache configuration and transforming nest for given fixed cache configuration may not be possible due to data and control dependences working with fixed cache configuration can also increase energy consumption in loops where the best required configuration is smaller than the default fixed one in this paper we take an alternate approach and modify the cache configuration for each nest depending on the access pattern exhibited by the nest we call this technique compiler directed cache polymorphism cdcp more specifically in this paper we make the following contributions first we present an approach for analyzing data reuse properties of loop nests second we give algorithms to simulate the footprints of array references in their reuse space third based on our reuse analysis we present an optimization algorithm to compute the cache configurations for each loop nest our experimental results show that cdcp is very effective in finding the near optimal data cache configurations for different nests in array intensive applications
it is envisaged that the application of the multilevel security mls scheme will enhance flexibility and effectiveness of authorization policies in shared enterprise databases and will replace cumbersome authorization enforcement practices through complicated view definitions on per user basis however as advances in this area are being made and ideas crystallized the concomitant weaknesses of the mls databases are also surfacing we insist that the critical problem with the current model is that the belief at higher security level is cluttered with irrelevant or inconsistent data as no mechanism for attenuation is supported critics also argue that it is imperative for mls database users to theorize about the belief of others perhaps at different security levels an apparatus that is currently missing and the absence of which is seriously felt the impetus for our current research is this need to provide an adequate framework for belief reasoning in mls databases we demonstrate that prudent application of the concept of inheritance in deductive database setting will help capture the notion of declarative belief and belief reasoning in mls databases in an elegant way to this end we develop function to compute belief in multiple modes which can be used to reason about the beliefs of other users we strive to develop poised and practical logical characterization of mls databases for the first time based on the inherently difficult concept of non monotonic inheritance we present an extension of the acclaimed datalog language called the multilog and show that datalog is special case of our language we also suggest an implementation scheme for multilog as front end for coral
in this paper we propose formal analysis approach to estimate the expected average data cache access time of an application across all possible program inputs towards this goal we introduce the notion of probabilistic access history that intuitively summarizes the history of data memory accesses along different program paths to reach particular program point and their associated probabilities an efficient static program analysis technique has been developed to compute the access history at all program points we estimate the cache hit miss probabilities and hence the expected access time of each data memory reference from the access history our experimental evaluation confirms the accuracy and viability of the probabilistic data cache modeling approach
this paper presents new static type system for multithreaded programs well typed programs in our system are guaranteed to be free of data races and deadlocks our type system allows programmers to partition the locks into fixed number of equivalence classes and specify partial order among the equivalence classes the type checker then statically verifies that whenever thread holds more than one lock the thread acquires the locks in the descending orderour system also allows programmers to use recursive tree based data structures to describe the partial order for example programmers can specify that nodes in tree must be locked in the tree order our system allows mutations to the data structure that change the partial order at runtime the type checker statically verifies that the mutations do not introduce cycles in the partial order and that the changing of the partial order does not lead to deadlocks we do not know of any other sound static system for preventing deadlocks that allows changes to the partial order at runtimeour system uses variant of ownership types to prevent data races and deadlocks ownership types provide statically enforceable way of specifying object encapsulation ownership types are useful for preventing data races and deadlocks because the lock that protects an object can also protect its encapsulated objects this paper describes how to use our type system to statically enforce object encapsulation as well as prevent data races and deadlocks the paper also contains detailed discussion of different ownership type systems and the encapsulation guarantees they provide

many of the existing approaches in software comprehension focus on program structure or external documentation however by analyzing formal information the informal semantics contained in the vocabulary of source code are overlooked to understand software as whole we need to enrich software analysis with the developer knowledge hidden in the code naming this paper proposes the use of information retrieval to exploit linguistic information found in source code such as identifier names and comments we introduce semantic clustering technique based on latent semantic indexing and clustering to group source artifacts that use similar vocabulary we call these groups semantic clusters and we interpret them as linguistic topics that reveal the intention of the code we compare the topics to each other identify links between them provide automatically retrieved labels and use visualization to illustrate how they are distributed over the system our approach is language independent as it works at the level of identifier names to validate our approach we applied it on several case studies two of which we present in this paper note some of the visualizations presented make heavy use of colors please obtain color copy of the article for better understanding
existing work on software connectors shows significant disagreement on both their definition and their relationships with components coordinators and adaptors we propose precise characterisation of connectors discuss how they relate to the other three classes and contradict the suggestion that connectors and components are disjoint we discuss the relationship between connectors and coupling and argue the inseparability of connection models from component programming models finally we identify the class of configuration languages show how it relates to primitive connectors and outline relevant areas for future work
the area under the roc receiver operating characteristics curve or simply auc has been traditionally used in medical diagnosis since the it has recently been proposed as an alternative single number measure for evaluating the predictive ability of learning algorithms however no formal arguments were given as to why auc should be preferred over accuracy in this paper we establish formal criteria for comparing two different measures for learning algorithms and we show theoretically and empirically that auc is better measure defined precisely than accuracy we then reevaluate well established claims in machine learning based on accuracy using auc and obtain interesting and surprising new results for example it has been well established and accepted that naive bayes and decision trees are very similar in predictive accuracy we show however that naive bayes is significantly better than decision trees in auc the conclusions drawn in this paper may make significant impact on machine learning and data mining applications

many data warehouse systems have been developed recently yet data warehouse practice is not sufficiently sophisticated for practical usage most data warehouse systems have some limitations in terms of flexibility efficiency and scalability in particular the sizes of these data warehouses are forever growing and becoming overloaded with data scenario that leads to difficulties in data maintenance and data analysis this research focuses on data information integration between data cubes this research might contribute to the resolution of two concerns the problem of redundancy and the problem of data cubes independent information this work presents semantic cube model which extends object oriented technology to data warehouses and which enables users to design the generalization relationship between different cubes in this regard this work's objectives are to improve the performance of query integrity and to reduce data duplication in data warehouse to deal with the handling of increasing data volume in data warehouses we discovered important inter relationships that hold among data cubes that facilitate information integration and that prevent the loss of data semantics
the vision of future electronic marketplaces markets is that of markets being populated by autonomous intelligent entities software trading agents representing their users or owners and conducting business on their behalf for this vision to materialize one fundamental issue that needs to be addressed is that of trust first users need to be able to trust that the agents will do what they say they do second they need to be confident that their privacy is protected and that the security risks involved in entrusting agents to perform transactions on their behalf are minimized finally users need to be assured that any legal issues relating to agents trading electronically are fully covered as they are in traditional trading practices in this paper we consider the barriers for the adoption of agent technology in electronic commerce commerce which pertain to trust security and legal issues we discuss the perceived risks of the use of agents in commerce and the fundamental issue of trust in this context issues regarding security and how some of these can be addressed through the use of cryptography are described the impact of the use of agent technology on the users privacy and how it can be both protected as well as hindered by it is also examined finally we discuss the legal issues that arise in agent mediated commerce and discuss the idea of attributing to software agents the status of legal persons or persons and the various implications
wireless sensor networks have been proposed for multitude of location dependent applications for such systems the cost and limitations of the hardware on sensing nodes prevent the use of range based localization schemes that depend on absolute point to point distance estimates because coarse accuracy is sufficient for most sensor network applications solutions in range free localization are being pursued as cost effective alternative to more expensive range based approaches in this paper we present apit novel localization algorithm that is range free we show that our apit scheme performs best when an irregular radio pattern and random node placement are considered and low communication overhead is desired we compare our work via extensive simulation with three state of the art range free localization schemes to identify the preferable system configurations of each in addition we study the effect of location error on routing and tracking performance we show that routing performance and tracking accuracy are not significantly affected by localization error when the error is less than times the communication radio radius
xml data can be represented by tree or graph structure and xml query processing requires the information of structural relationships among nodes the basic structural relationships are parent child and ancestor descendant and finding all occurrences of these basic structural relationships in an xml data is clearly core operation in xml query processing several node labeling schemes have been suggested to support the determination of ancestor descendant or parent child structural relationships simply by comparing the labels of nodes however the previous node labeling schemes have some disadvantages such as large number of nodes that need to be relabeled in the case of an insertion of xml data huge space requirements for node labels and inefficient processing of structural joins in this paper we propose the nested tree structure that eliminates the disadvantages and takes advantage of the previous node labeling schemes the nested tree structure makes it possible to use the dynamic interval based labeling scheme which supports xml data updates with almost no node relabeling as well as efficient structural join processing experimental results show that our approach is efficient in handling updates with the interval based labeling scheme and also significantly improves the performance of the structural join processing compared with recent methods
component programming techniques encourage abstraction and reuse through external linking some parts of program however must use concrete internally specified references so pure component system is not sufficient mechanism for structuring programs we present the combination of static internally linked module system and purely abstractive component system the latter extends our previous model of typed units to properly account for translucency and sharing we also show how units and modules can express an sml style system of structures and functors and we explore the consequences for recursive structures and functors
in this paper we kernelize conventional clustering algorithms from novel point of view based on the fully mathematical proof we first demonstrate that kernel kmeans kkmeans is equivalent to kernel principal component analysis kpca prior to the conventional kmeans algorithm by using kpca as preprocessing step we also generalize gaussian mixture model gmm to its kernel version the kernel gmm kgmm consequently conventional clustering algorithms can be easily kernelized in the linear feature space instead of nonlinear one to evaluate the newly established kkmeans and kgmm algorithms we utilized them to the problem of semantic object extraction segmentation of color images based on series of experiments carried out on set of color images we indicate that both kkmeans and kgmm can offer more elaborate output than the conventional kmeans and gmm respectively
various index structures have been proposed to speed up the evaluation of xml path expressions however existing xml path indices suffer from at least one of three limitations they focus only on indexing the structure relying on separate index for node content they are useful only for simple path expressions such as root to leaf paths or they cannot be tightly integrated with relational query processor moreover there is no unified framework to compare these index structures in this paper we present framework defining family of index structures that includes most existing xml path indices we also propose two novel index structures in this family with different space time tradeoffs that are effective for the evaluation of xml branching path expressions ie twigs with value conditions we also show how this family of index structures can be implemented using the access methods of the underlying relational database system finally we present an experimental evaluation that shows the performance tradeoff between index space and matching time the experimental results show that our novel indices achieve orders of magnitude improvement in performance for evaluating twig queries albeit at higher space cost over the use of previously proposed xml path indices that can be tightly integrated with relational query processor
this paper addresses performance bottleneck in time series subsequence matching first we analyze the disk access and cpu processing times required during the index searching and post processing steps of subsequence matching through preliminary experiments based on their results we show that the post processing step is main performance bottleneck in subsequence matching in order to resolve the performance bottleneck we propose simple yet quite effective method that processes the post processing step by rearranging the order of candidate subsequences to be compared with query sequence our method completely eliminates the redundancies of disk accesses and cpu processing occurring in the post processing step we show that our method is optimal and also does not incur any false dismissal also we justify the effectiveness of our method by extensive experiments
software maintenance is expensive and difficult because soft ware is complex and maintenance requires the understanding of code written by someone else prerequisite to maintainability is program understanding specifically understanding the control flows between software components this is especially problematic for emerging software technologies such as the world wide web because of the lack of formal development practices and because web applications comprise mix of static and dynamic content adequate representations are therefore necessary to facilitate program understanding this research proposes an approach called readable readable executable augmentable database linked environment that generates executable tabular representations that can be used to both understand and manipulate software applications controlled laboratory experiment carried out to test the efficacy of the approach demonstrates that the representations significantly enhance program understanding the results suggest that the approach and the corresponding environment may be useful to alleviate problems associated with the software maintainability of new web applications
structured texts for example dictionaries and user manuals typically have heirarchical tree like structure we describe query language for retrieving information from collections of hierarchical text the language is based on tree pattern matching notion called tree inclusion tree inclusion allows easy expression of queries that use the structure and the content of the document in using it user need not be aware of the whole structure of the database thus language based on tree inclusion is data independent property made necessary because of the great variance in the structure of the texts
this paper presents an approach to matching parts of deformable shapes multiscale salient parts of the two shapes are first identified then these parts are matched if their immediate properties are similar the same holds recursively for their subparts and the same holds for their neighbor parts the shapes are represented by hierarchical attributed graphs whose node attributes encode the photometric and geometric properties of corresponding parts and edge attributes capture the strength of neighbor and part of interactions between the parts their matching is formulated as finding the subgraph isomorphism that minimizes quadratic cost the dimensionality of the matching space is dramatically reduced by convexifying the cost experimental evaluation on the benchmark mpeg and brown datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach is robust
tree automata completion is technique for the verification of infinite state systems it has already been used for the verification of cryptographic protocols and the prototyping of java static analyzers however as for many other verification techniques the correctness of the associated tool becomes more and more difficult to guarantee it is due to the size of the implementation that constantly grows and due to optimizations which are necessary to scale up the efficiency of the tool to verify real size systems in this paper we define and develop checker for tree automata produced by completion the checker is defined using coq and its implementation is automatically extracted from its formal specification using extraction gives checker that can be run independently of the coq environment specific algorithm for tree automata inclusion checking has been defined so as to avoid the exponential blow up the obtained checker is certified in coq independent of the implementation of completion usable with any approximation performed during completion small and fast some benchmarks are given to show how efficient the tool is
shape skeletons are fundamental concepts for describing the shape of geometric objects and have found variety of applications in number of areas where geometry plays an important role two types of skeletons commonly used in geometric computations are the straight skeleton of linear polygon and the medial axis of bounded set of points in the dimensional euclidean space however exact computation of these skeletons of even fairly simple planar shapes remains an open problem in this paper we propose novel approach to construct exact or approximate continuous distance functions and the associated skeletal representations skeleton and the corresponding radius function for solid semi analytic sets that can be either rigid or undergoing topological deformations our approach relies on computing constructive representations of shapes with functions that operate on real valued halfspaces as logic operations we use our approximate distance functions to define new type of skeleton ie the skeleton which is piecewise linear for polygonal domains generalizes naturally to planar and spatial domains with curved boundaries and has attractive properties we also show that the exact distance functions allow us to compute the medial axis of any closed bounded and regular planar domain importantly our approach can generate the medial axis the straight skeleton and the skeleton of possibly deformable shapes within the same formulation extends naturally to and can be used in variety of applications such as skeleton based shape editing and adaptive motion planning
this paper offers an exploration of the attitudes of older adults to keeping in touch with people who are important to them we present findings from three focus groups with people from to years of age themes emerging from the findings suggest that older adults view the act of keeping in touch as being worthy of time and dedication but also as being something that needs to be carefully managed within the context of daily life communication is seen as means through which skill should be demonstrated and personality expressed and is understood in very different context to the lightweight interaction that is increasingly afforded by new technologies the themes that emerged are used to elicit number of design implications and to promote some illustrative design concepts for new communication devices
software has spent the bounty of moore's law by solving harder problems and exploiting abstractions such as high level languages virtual machine technology binary rewriting and dynamic analysis abstractions make programmers more productive and programs more portable but usually slow them down since moore's law is now delivering multiple cores instead of faster processors future systems must either bear relatively higher cost for abstractions or use some cores to help tolerate abstraction costs this paper presents the design implementation and evaluation of novel concurrent configurable dynamic analysis framework that efficiently utilizes multicore cache architectures it introduces cache friendly asymmetric buffering cab lock free ring buffer that implements efficient communication between application and analysis threads we guide the design and implementation of our framework with model of dynamic analysis overheads the framework implements exhaustive and sampling event processing and is analysis neutral we evaluate the framework with five popular and diverse analyses and show performance improvements even for lightweight low overhead analyses efficient inter core communication is central to high performance parallel systems and we believe the cab design gives insight into the subtleties and difficulties of attaining it for dynamic analysis and other parallel software
recent work has shown that the physical connectivity of the internet exhibits small world behavior characterizing such behavior is important not only for generating realistic internet topology but also for the proper evaluation of large scale content delivery mechanisms along this line this paper tries to understand how small world behavior arises in the internet topologies and how it impacts the performance of multicast techniques first we attribute small world behavior to two possible causes namely the variability of vertex degree and the preference for local connections for vertices we have found that both factors contribute with different relative degrees to the small world behavior of autonomous system as level and router level internet topologies for as level topology we observe that high variability of vertex degree is sufficient to cause small world behavior but for router level topology preference for local connectivity plays more important role second we propose better models to generate small world internet topologies our models incorporate both causes of small world behavior and generate graphs closely resemble real internet graphs third using simulation we demonstrate the importance of our work by studying the scaling behavior of multicast techniques we show that multicast tree size largely depends on network topology if topology generators capture only the variability of vertex degree they are likely to underestimate the benefit of multicast techniques
there is currently an abundance of social network services available on the internet in addition examples of location aware social network services are emerging the use of such services presents interesting consequences for users privacy and behaviour and ultimately the adoption of such services yet not lot of explicit knowledge is available that addresses these issues the work presented here tries to answer this by investigating the willingness to use location aware service in population of students during three week festival the main findings show that most users are willing to use such systems also on larger scale however some reservations particularly with regard to privacy are uncovered
cache memories in embedded systems play an important role in reducing the execution time of the applications various kinds of extensions have been added to cache hardware to enable software involvement in replacement decisions thus improving the run time over purely hardware managed cache novel embedded systems like intel's xscale and arm cortex processors provide the facility of locking one or more lines in cache this feature is called cache locking this paper presents the first method in the literature for instruction cache locking that is able to reduce the average case run time of the program we devise cost benefit model to discover the memory addresses which should be locked in the cache we implement our scheme inside binary rewriter thus widening the applicability of our scheme to binaries compiled using any compiler results obtained on suite of mibench and mediabench benchmarks show up to improvement in the instruction cache miss rate on average and up to improvement in the execution time on average for applications having instruction accesses as bottleneck depending on the cache configuration the improvement in execution time is as high as for some benchmarks
regular path expressions are essential for formulating queries over the semistructured data without specifying the exact structure the query pruning is an important optimization technique to avoid useless traversals in evaluating regular path expressions while the previous query pruning optimizes single regular path expression well it often fails to fully optimize multiple regular path expressions nevertheless multiple regular path expressions are very frequently used in nontrivial queries and so an effective optimization technique for them is required in this paper we present new technique called the two phase query pruning that consists of the preprocessing phase and the pruning phase our two phase query pruning is effective in optimizing multiple regular path expressions and is more scalable and efficient than the combination of the previous query pruning and post processing in that it never deals with exponentially many combinations of sub results produced from all the regular path expressions
web search engines typically provide search results without considering user interests or context we propose personalized search approach that can easily extend conventional search engine on the client side our mapping framework automatically maps set of known user interests onto group of categories in the open directory project odp and takes advantage of manually edited data available in odp for training text classifiers that correspond to and therefore categorize and personalize search results according to user interests in two sets of controlled experiments we compare our personalized categorization system pcat with list interface system list that mimics typical search engine and with nonpersonalized categorization system cat in both experiments we analyze system performances on the basis of the type of task and query length we find that pcat is preferable to list for information gathering types of tasks and for searches with short queries and pcat outperforms cat in both information gathering and finding types of tasks and for searches associated with free form queries from the subjects answers to questionnaire we find that pcat is perceived as system that can find relevant web pages quicker and easier than list and cat
the discovery of biclusters which denote groups of items that show coherent values across subset of all the transactions in data set is an important type of analysis performed on real valued data sets in various domains such as biology several algorithms have been proposed to find different types of biclusters in such data sets however these algorithms are unable to search the space of all possible biclusters exhaustively pattern mining algorithms in association analysis also essentially produce biclusters as their result since the patterns consist of items that are supported by subset of all the transactions however major limitation of the numerous techniques developed in association analysis is that they are only able to analyze data sets with binary and or categorical variables and their application to real valued data sets often involves some lossy transformation such as discretization or binarization of the attributes in this paper we propose novel association analysis framework for exhaustively and efficiently mining range support patterns from such data set on one hand this framework reduces the loss of information incurred by the binarization and discretization based approaches and on the other it enables the exhaustive discovery of coherent biclusters we compared the performance of our framework with two standard biclustering algorithms through the evaluation of the similarity of the cellular functions of the genes constituting the patterns biclusters derived by these algorithms from microarray data these experiments show that the real valued patterns discovered by our framework are better enriched by small biologically interesting functional classes also through specific examples we demonstrate the ability of the rap framework to discover functionally enriched patterns that are not found by the commonly used biclustering algorithm isa the source code and data sets used in this paper as well as the supplementary material are available at http wwwcsumnedu vk gaurav rap
in building large scale video server it is highly desirable to use heterogeneous disk subsystems for the following reasons first existing disks may fail especially in an environment with large number of disks enforcing the use of new disks second for scalable server to cope with the increasing demand of customers new disks may be needed to increase the server apos storage capacity and throughput with rapid advances in the performance of disks the newly added disks generally have higher data transfer rate and larger storage capacity than the disks originally in the system in this paper we propose novel striping scheme termed as resource based striping rbs for video servers built on heterogeneous disks rbs combines the techniques of wide striping and narrow striping so that it can obtain the optimal stripe allocation and efficiently utilize both the bandwidth and storage capacity of all disks rbs is suitable for applications whose files are not updated frequently such as course on demand and movie on demand we examine the performance of rbs via simulation experiments our results show that rbs greatly outperforms the conventional striping schemes proposed for video servers with heterogeneous or homogeneous disks in terms of the number of simultaneous streams supported and the number of files that can be stored

we introduce new acceleration to the standard splatting volume rendering algorithm our method achieves full colour bit depth sorted and shaded volume rendering significantly faster than standard splatting the speedup is due to dimensional adjacency data structure that efficiently skips transparent parts of the data and stores only the voxels that are potentially visible our algorithm is robust and flexible allowing for depth sorting of the data including correct back to front ordering for perspective projections this makes interactive splatting possible for applications such as medical visualizations that rely on structure and depth information
in this paper new method to improve the utilization of main memory systems is presented the new method is based on prestoring in main memory number of query answers each evaluated out of single memory page to this end the ideas of page answers and page traces are formally described and their properties analyzed the query model used here allows for selection projection join recursive queries as well as arbitrary combinations we also show how to apply the approach under update traffic this concept is especially useful in managing the main memories of an important class of applications this class includes the evaluation of triggers and alerters performance improvement of rule based systems integrity constraint checking and materialized views these applications are characterized by the existence at compile time of predetermined set of queries by slow but persistent update traffic and by their need to repetitively reevaluate the query set the new approach represents new type of intelligent database caching which contrasts with traditional caching primarily in that the cache elements are derived data and as consequence they overlap arbitrarily and do not have fixed length the contents of the main memory cache are selected based on the data distribution within the database the set of fixed queries to preprocess and the paging characteristics page answers and page traces are used as the smallest indivisible units in the cache an efficient heuristic to select near optimal set of page answers and page traces to populate the main memory has been developed implemented and tested finally quantitative measurements of performance benefits are reported
all frequent itemset mining algorithms rely heavily on the monotonicity principle for pruning this principle allows for excluding candidate itemsets from the expensive counting phase in this paper we present sound and complete deduction rules to derive bounds on the support of an itemset based on these deduction rules we construct condensed representation of all frequent itemsets by removing those itemsets for which the support can be derived resulting in the so called non derivable itemsets ndi representation we also present connections between our proposal and recent other proposals for condensed representations of frequent itemsets experiments on real life datasets show the effectiveness of the ndi representation making the search for frequent non derivable itemsets useful and tractable alternative to mining all frequent itemsets

in degree pagerank number of visits and other measures of web page popularity significantly influence the ranking of search results by modern search engines the assumption is that popularity is closely correlated with quality more elusive concept that is difficult to measure directly unfortunately the correlation between popularity and quality is very weak for newly created pages that have yet to receive many visits and or in links worse since discovery of new content is largely done by querying search engines and because users usually focus their attention on the top few results newly created but high quality pages are effectively shut out and it can take very long time before they become popularwe propose simple and elegant solution to this problem the introduction of controlled amount of randomness into search result ranking methods doing so offers new pages chance to prove their worth although clearly using too much randomness will degrade result quality and annul any benefits achieved hence there is tradeoff between exploration to estimate the quality of new pages and exploitation of pages already known to be of high quality we study this tradeoff both analytically and via simulation in the context of an economic objective function based on aggregate result quality amortized over time we show that modest amount of randomness leads to improved search results
the ever growing needs of large multimedia systems cannot be met by magnetic disks due to their high cost and low storage density consequently cheaper and denser tertiary storage systems are being integrated into the storage hierarchies of these applications although tertiary storage is cheaper the access latency is very high due to the need to load and unload media on the drives this high latency and the bursty nature of traffic result in the accumulation of requests for tertiary storage we study the problem of scheduling these requests to improve performance in particular we address the issues of scheduling across multiple tapes or disks as opposed to most other studies which consider only one or two media we focus on algorithms that minimize the number of switches and show through simulation that these result in near optimal schedules for single drive libraries an efficient algorithm that produces optimal schedules is developed for multiple drives the problem is shown to be np complete efficient and effective heuristics are presented for both single and multiple drives the scheduling policies developed achieve significant performance gains over naive policies the algorithms are simple to implement and are not restrictive the study encompasses all types of storage libraries handling removable media such as tapes and optical disks
botnets are networks of compromised computers infected with malicious code that can be controlled remotely under common command and control channel recognized as one the most serious security threats on current internet infrastructure advanced botnets are hidden not only in existing well known network applications eg irc http or peer to peer but also in some unknown or novel creative applications which makes the botnet detection challenging problem most current attempts for detecting botnets are to examine traffic content for bot signatures on selected network links or by setting up honeypots in this paper we propose new hierarchical framework to automatically discover botnets on large scale wifi isp network in which we first classify the network traffic into different application communities by using payload signatures and novel cross association clustering algorithm and then on each obtained application community we analyze the temporal frequent characteristics of flows that lead to the differentiation of malicious channels created by bots from normal traffic generated by human beings we evaluate our approach with about million flows collected over three consecutive days on large scale wifi isp network and results show the proposed approach successfully detects two types of botnet application flows ie blackenergy http bot and kaiten irc bot from about million flows with high detection rate and an acceptable low false alarm rate

this study investigates level set multiphase image segmentation by kernel mapping and piecewise constant modeling of the image data thereof kernel function maps implicitly the original data into data of higher dimension so that the piecewise constant model becomes applicable this leads to flexible and effective alternative to complex modeling of the image data the method uses an active curve objective functional with two terms an original term which evaluates the deviation of the mapped image data within each segmentation region from the piecewise constant model and classic length regularization term for smooth region boundaries functional minimization is carried out by iterations of two consecutive steps minimization with respect to the segmentation by curve evolution via euler lagrange descent equations and minimization with respect to the regions parameters via fixed point iterations using common kernel function this step amounts to mean shift parameter update we verified the effectiveness of the method by quantitative and comparative performance evaluation over large number of experiments on synthetic images as well as experiments with variety of real images such as medical satellite and natural images as well as motion maps
in main memory databases the number of processor cache misses has critical impact on the performance of the system cache conscious indices are designed to improve performance by reducing the number of processor cache misses that are incurred during search operation conventional wisdom suggests that the index's node size should be equal to the cache line size in order to minimize the number of cache misses and improve performance as we show in this paper this design choice ignores additional effects such as the number of instructions executed and the number of tlb misses which play significant role in determining the overall performance to capture the impact of node size on the performance of cache conscious tree csb tree we first develop an analytical model based on the fundamental components of the search process this model is then validated with an actual implementation demonstrating that the model is accurate both the analytical model and experiments confirm that using node sizes much larger than the cache line size can result in better search performance for the csb tree
adaptive user interface composition is the ability of software system to compose its user interface at runtime according to given deployment profile and to possibly drop running components and activate better alternatives in their place in response to deployment profile modifications while adaptive behavior has gained interest for wide range of software products and services its support is very demanding requiring adoption of user interface architectural patterns from the early software design stages while previous research addressed the issue of engineering adaptive systems from scratch there is an important methodological gap since we lack processes to reform existing non adaptive systems towards adaptive behavior we present stepwise transformation process of user interface software by incrementally upgrading relevant class structures towards adaptive composition by treating adaptive behavior as cross cutting concern all our refactoring examples have emerged from real practice
with the recent dramatic increase in electronic access to documents text categorization mdash the task of assigning topics to given document mdash has moved to the center of the information sciences and knowledge management this article uses the structure that is present in the semantic space of topics in order to improve performance in text categorization according to their meaning topics can be grouped together into ldquo meta topics rdquo eg gold silver and copper are all metals the proposed architecture matches the hierarchical structure of the topic space as opposed to flat model that ignores the structure it accommodates both single and multiple topic assignments for each document its probabilistic interpretation allows its predictions to be combined in principled way with information from other sources the first level of the architecture predicts the probabilities of the meta topic groups this allows the individual models for each topic on the second level to focus on finer discriminations within the group evaluating the performance of two level implementation on the reuters testbed of newswire articles shows the most significant improvement for rare classes
unanticipated connection of independently developed componentsis one of the key issues in component oriented programming while variety of component oriented languages have been proposed none of them has achieved breakthrough yet in this paper we present scl simple language dedicated to component oriented programming scl integrates well known features such as component class component interface port or service all these well known features are presented discussed and compared to existing approaches because they vary quite widely from one language to another but these features are not enough to build component language indeed most approaches use language primitives and shared interfaces to connect components but shared interfaces are in contradiction with the philosophy of independently developed components to this issue scl provides new features such as uniform component composition model based on connectors connectors represent interactions between independently developed components scl also integrates component properties which enable connections based on component state changes with no requirements of specific code in components
we provide type system inspired by affine intuitionistic logic for the calculus of higher order mobile embedded resources homer resulting in the first process calculus combining affine linear non copyable and non linear copyable higher order mobile processes nested locations and local names the type system guarantees that linear resources are neither copied nor embedded in non linear resources during computation we exemplify the use of the calculus by modelling simplistic cash smart card system the security of which depends on the interplay between linear mobile hardware embedded non linear mobile processes and local names purely linear calculus would not be able to express that embedded software processes may be copied conversely purely non linear calculus would not be able to express that mobile hardware processes cannot be copied
cryptographic operations are essential for many security critical systems reasoning about information flow in such systems is challenging because typical noninterference based information flow definitions allow no flow from secret to public data unfortunately this implies that programs with encryption are ruled out because encrypted output depends on secret inputs the plaintext and the key however it is desirable to allow flows arising from encryption with secret keys provided that the underlying cryptographic algorithm is strong enough in this article we conservatively extend the noninterference definition to allow safe encryption decryption and key generation to illustrate the usefulness of this approach we propose and implement type system that guarantees noninterference for small imperative language with primitive cryptographic operations the type system prevents dangerous program behavior eg giving away secret key or confusing keys and nonkeys which we exemplify with secure implementations of cryptographic protocols because the model is based on standard noninterference property it allows us to develop some natural extensions in particular we consider public key cryptography and integrity which accommodate reasoning about primitives that are vulnerable to chosen ciphertext attacks
with the multiplication of xml data sources many xml data warehouse models have been proposed to handle data heterogeneity and complexity in way relational data warehouses fail to achieve however xml native database systems currently suffer from limited performances both in terms of manageable data volume and response time fragmentation helps address both these issues derived horizontal fragmentation is typically used in relational data warehouses and can definitely be adapted to the xml context however the number of fragments produced by classical algorithms is difficult to control in this paper we propose the use of means based fragmentation approach that allows to master the number of fragments through its parameter we experimentally compare its efficiency to classical derived horizontal fragmentation algorithms adapted to xml data warehouses and show its superiority
with over us science and mathematics education standards and rapid proliferation of web enabled curriculum retrieving curriculum that aligns with the standards to which teachers must teach is key objective for educational digital libraries however previous studies of such alignment use single dimensional and binary measures of the alignment concept as consequence they suffer from low inter rater reliability irr with experts agreeing about alignments only some of the time we present the results of an experiment in which the alignment variable was operationalized using the saracevic model of relevance clues taken from the everyday practice of teaching results show high irr across all clues with irr on several specific alignment dimensions significantly higher than on overall alignment in addition model of overall alignment is derived and estimated the structure and explanatory power of the model as well as the relationships between alignment clues differ significantly between alignments of curriculum found by users themselves and curriculum found by others these results illustrate the usefulness of clue based relevance measures for information retrieval and have important consequences for both the formulation of automated retrieval mechanisms and the construction of gold standard or benchmark set of standard curriculum alignments
open distributed systems are becoming increasingly popular such systems include components that may be obtained from number of different sources for example java allows run time loading of software components residing on remote machines one unfortunate side effect of this openness is the possibility that hostile software components may compromise the security of both the program and the system on which it runs java offers built in security mechanism using which programmers can give permissions to distributed components and check these permissions at run time this security model is flexible but using it is not straightforward which may lead to insufficiently tight permission checking and therefore breaches of securityin this paper we propose data flow algorithm for automated analysis of the flow of permissions in java programs our algorithm produces for given instruction in the program set of permissions that are checked on all possible executions up to this instruction this information can be used in program understanding tools or directly for checking properties that assert what permissions must always be checked before access to certain functionality is allowed the worst case complexity of our algorithm is low order polynomial in the number of program statements and permission types while comparable previous approaches have exponential costs

this paper presents generative model for textures that uses local sparse description of the image content this model enforces the sparsity of the expansion of local texture patches on adapted atomic elements the analysis of given texture within this framework performs the sparse coding of all the patches of the texture into the dictionary of atoms conversely the synthesis of new texture is performed by solving an optimization problem that seeks for texture whose patches are sparse in the dictionary this paper explores several strategies to choose this dictionary set of hand crafted dictionaries composed of edges oscillations lines or crossings elements allows to synthesize synthetic images with geometric features another option is to define the dictionary as the set of all the patches of an input exemplar this leads to computer graphics methods for synthesis and shares some similarities with non local means filtering the last method we explore learns the dictionary by an optimization process that maximizes the sparsity of set of exemplar patches applications of all these methods to texture synthesis inpainting and classification shows the efficiency of the proposed texture model
optical flow computation is well known technique and there are important fields in which the application of this visual modality commands high interest nevertheless most real world applications require real time processing an issue which has only recently been addressed most real time systems described to date use basic models which limit their applicability to generic tasks especially when fast motion is presented or when subpixel motion resolution is required therefore instead of implementing complex optical flow approach we describe here very high frame rate optical flow processing system recent advances in image sensor technology make it possible nowadays to use high frame rate sensors to properly sample fast motion ie as low motion scene which makes gradient based approach one of the best options in terms of accuracy and consumption of resources for any real time implementation taking advantage of the regular data flow of this kind of algorithm our approach implements novel superpipelined fully parallelized architecture for optical flow processing the system is fully working and is organized into more than pipeline stages which achieve data throughput of one pixel per clock cycle this computing scheme is well suited to fpga technology and vlsi implementation the developed customized dsp architecture is capable of processing up to frames per second at resolution of pixels we discuss the advantages of high frame rate processing and justify the optical flow model chosen for the implementation we analyze this architecture measure the system resource requirements using fpga devices and finally evaluate the system's performance and compare it with other approaches described in the literature
hardware systems and reactive software systems can be described as the composition of several concurrently active processes automated reasoning based on model checking algorithms can substantially increase confidence in the overall reliability of system direct methods for model checking concurrent composition however usually suffer from the explosion in the number of program states that arises from concurrency reasoning compositionally about individual processes helps mitigate this problem number of rules have been proposed for compositional reasoning typically based on an assume guarantee reasoning paradigm reasoning with these rules can be delicate as some are syntactically circular in nature in that assumptions and guarantees are mutually dependent this is known to be source of unsoundness in this article we investigate rules for compositional reasoning from the viewpoint of completeness we show that several rules are incomplete that is there are properties whose validity cannot be established using only these rules we derive new circular reasoning rule and show it to be sound and complete we show that the auxiliary assertions needed for completeness need be defined only on the interface of the component processes we also show that the two main paradigms of circular and noncircular reasoning are closely related in that proof of one type can be transformed in straightforward manner to one of the other type these results give some insight into the applicability of compositional reasoning methods
the development of new techniques and the emergence of new high throughput tools have led to new information revolution the amount and the diversity of the information that need to be stored and processed have led to the adoption of data integration systems in order to deal with information extraction from disparate sources the mediation between traditional databases and ontologies has been recognized as cornerstone issue in bringing in legacy data with formal semantic meaning however our knowledge evolves due to the rapid scientific development so ontologies and schemata need to change in order to capture and accommodate such an evolution when ontologies change these changes should somehow be rendered and used by the pre existing data integration systems problem that most of the integration systems seem to ignore in this paper we review existing approaches for ontology schema evolution and examine their applicability in state of the art ontology based data integration setting then we show that changes in schemata differ significantly from changes in ontologies this strengthens our position that current state of the art systems are not adequate for ontology based data integration so we give the requirements for an ideal data integration system that will enable and exploit ontology evolution
abstract recurrent neural networks readily process recognize and generate temporal sequences by encoding grammatical strings as temporal sequences recurrent neural networks can be trained to behave like deterministic sequential finite state automata algorithms have been developed for extracting grammatical rules from trained networks using simple method for inserting prior knowledge or rules into recurrent neural networks we show that recurrent neural networks are able to perform rule revision rule revision is performed by comparing the inserted rules with the rules in the finite state automata extracted from trained networks the results from training recurrent neural network to recognize known non trivial randomly generated regular grammar show that not only do the networks preserve correct rules but that they are able to correct through training inserted rules which were initially incorrect by incorrect we mean that the rules were not the ones in the randomly generated grammar
recently mining from data streams has become an important and challenging task for many real world applications such as credit card fraud protection and sensor networking one popular solution is to separate stream data into chunks learn base classifier from each chunk and then integrate all base classifiers for effective classification in this paper we propose new dynamic classifier selection dcs mechanism to integrate base classifiers for effective mining from data streams the proposed algorithm dynamically selects single best classifier to classify each test instance at run time our scheme uses statistical information from attribute values and uses each attribute to partition the evaluation set into disjoint subsets followed by procedure that evaluates the classification accuracy of each base classifier on these subsets given test instance its attribute values determine the subsets that the similar instances in the evaluation set have constructed and the classifier with the highest classification accuracy on those subsets is selected to classify the test instance experimental results and comparative studies demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our method such dcs scheme appears to be promising in mining data streams with dramatic concept drifting or with significant amount of noise where the base classifiers are likely conflictive or have low confidence
in this work we address the issue of efficient processing of range queries in dht based pp data networks the novelty of the proposed approach lies on architectures algorithms and mechanisms for identifying and appropriately exploiting powerful nodes in such networks the existence of such nodes has been well documented in the literature and plays key role in the architecture of most successful real world pp applications however till now this heterogeneity has not been taken into account when architecting solutions for complex query processing especially in dht networks with this work we attempt to fill this gap for optimizing the processing of range queries significant performance improvements are achieved due to ensuring much smaller hop count performance for range queries and ii avoiding the dangers and inefficiencies of relying for range query processing on weak nodes with respect to processing storage and communication capacities and with intermittent connectivity we present detailed experimental results validating our performance claims
we present the auckland layout model alm constraint based technique for specifying layout as it is used for arranging the controls in graphical user interface gui most gui frameworks offer layout managers that are basically adjustable tables often adjacent table cells can be merged in the alm the focus switches from the table cells to vertical and horizontal tabulators between the cells on the lowest level of abstraction the model applies linear constraints and an optimal layout is calculated using linear programming however bare linear programming makes layout specification cumbersome and unintuitive especially for gui domain experts who are often not used to such mathematical formalisms in order to improve the usability of the model alm offers several other layers of abstraction that make it possible to define common gui layout more easily in the domain of user interfaces it is important that specifications are not over constrained therefore alm introduces soft constraints which are automatically translated to appropriate hard linear constraints and terms in the objective function guis are usually composed of rectangular areas containing controls therefore alm offers an abstraction for such areas dynamic resizing behavior is very important for guis hence areas have domain specific parameters specifying their minimum maximum and preferred sizes from such definitions hard and soft constraints are automatically derived third level of abstraction allows designers to arrange guis in tabular fashion using abstractions for columns and rows which offer additional parameters for ordering and alignment row and column definitions are used to automatically generate definitions from lower levels of abstraction such as hard and soft constraints and areas specifications from all levels of abstraction can be consistently combined offering gui developers rich set of tools that is much closer to their needs than pure linear constraints incremental computation of solutions makes constraint solving fast enough for near real time use
in the area of image retrieval from data bases and for copyright protection of large image collections there is growing demand for unique but easily computable fingerprints for images these fingerprints can be used to quickly identify every image within larger set of possibly similar images this paper introduces novel method to automatically obtain such fingerprints from an image it is based on reinterpretation of an image as riemannian manifold this representation is feasible for gray value images and color images we discuss the use of the spectrum of eigenvalues of different variants of the laplace operator as fingerprint and show the usability of this approach in several use cases contrary to existing works in this area we do not only use the discrete laplacian but also with particular emphasis the underlying continuous operator this allows better results in comparing the resulting spectra and deeper insights in the problems arising we show how the well known discrete laplacian is related to the continuous laplace beltrami operator furthermore we introduce the new concept of solid height functions to overcome some potential limitations of the method
liveness analysis is an important analysis in optimizing compilers liveness information is used in several optimizations and is mandatory during the code generation phase two drawbacks of conventional liveness analyses are that their computations are fairly expensive and their results are easily invalidated by program transformations we present method to check liveness of variables that overcomes both obstacles the major advantage of the proposed method is that the analysis result survives all program transformations except for changes in the control flow graph for common program sizes our technique is faster and consumes less memory than conventional data flow approaches thereby we heavily make use of ssa form properties which allow us to completely circumvent data flow equation solving we evaluate the competitiveness of our approach in an industrial strength compiler our measurements use the integer part of the spec benchmarks and investigate the liveness analysis used by the ssa destruction pass we compare the net time spent in liveness computations of our implementation against the one provided by that compiler the results show that in the vast majority of cases our algorithm while providing the same quality of information needs less time an average speed up of

name ambiguity problem has raised an urgent demand for efficient high quality named entity disambiguation methods the key problem of named entity disambiguation is to measure the similarity between occurrences of names the traditional methods measure the similarity using the bag of words bow model the bow however ignores all the semantic relations such as social relatedness between named entities associative relatedness between concepts polysemy and synonymy between key terms so the bow cannot reflect the actual similarity some research has investigated social networks as background knowledge for disambiguation social networks however can only capture the social relatedness between named entities and often suffer the limited coverage problem to overcome the previous methods deficiencies this paper proposes to use wikipedia as the background knowledge for disambiguation which surpasses other knowledge bases by the coverage of concepts rich semantic information and up to date content by leveraging wikipedia's semantic knowledge like social relatedness between named entities and associative relatedness between concepts we can measure the similarity between occurrences of names more accurately in particular we construct large scale semantic network from wikipedia in order that the semantic knowledge can be used efficiently and effectively based on the constructed semantic network novel similarity measure is proposed to leverage wikipedia semantic knowledge for disambiguation the proposed method has been tested on the standard weps data sets empirical results show that the disambiguation performance of our method gets improvement over the traditional bow based methods and improvement over the traditional social network based methods

grids involve coordinated resource sharing and problem solving in heterogeneous dynamic environments to meet the needs of generation of researchers requiring large amounts of bandwidth and more powerful computational resources the lack of resource ownership by grid schedulers and fluctuations in resource availability require mechanisms which will enable grids to adjust themselves to cope with fluctuations the lack of central controller implies need for self adaptation grids must thus be enabled with the ability to discover monitor and manage the use of resources so they can operate autonomously two different approaches have been conceived to match the resource demands of grid applications to resource availability dynamic scheduling and adaptive scheduling however these two approaches fail to address at least one of three important issues the production of feasible schedules in reasonable amount of time in relation to that required for the execution of an application ii the impact of network link availability on the execution time of an application and iii the necessity of migrating codes to decrease the execution time of an application to overcome these challenges this paper proposes procedure for enabling grid applications composed of various dependent tasks to deal with the availability of hosts and links bandwidth this procedure involves task scheduling resource monitoring and task migration with the goal of decreasing the execution time of grid applications the procedure differs from other approaches in the literature because it constantly considers changes in resource availability especially network bandwidth availability to trigger task migration the proposed procedure is illustrated via simulation using various scenarios involving fluctuation of resource availability an additional contribution of this paper is the introduction of set of schedulers offering solutions which differ in terms of both schedule length and computational complexity the distinguishing aspect of this set of schedulers is the consideration of time requirements in the production of feasible schedules performance is then evaluated considering various network topologies and task dependencies
this paper proposes weighted power series model for face verification scores fusion essentially linear parametric power series model is adopted to directly minimize an approximated total error rate for fusion of multi modal face verification scores unlike the conventional least squares error minimization approach which involves fitting of learning model to data density and then perform threshold process for error counting this work directly formulates the required target error count rate in terms of design model parameters with closed form solution the solution is found to belong to specific setting of the weighted least squares our experiments on fusing scores from visual and infra red face images as well as on public data sets show promising results

this paper analyzes memory access scheduling and virtual channels as mechanisms to reduce the latency of main memory accesses by the cpu and peripherals in web servers despite the address filtering effects of the cpu's cache hierarchy there is significant locality and bank parallelism in the dram access stream of web server which includes traffic from the operating system application and peripherals however sequential memory controller leaves much of this locality and parallelism unexploited as serialization and bank conflicts affect the realizable latency aggressive scheduling within the memory controller to exploit the available parallelism and locality can reduce the average read latency of the sdram however bank conflicts and the limited ability of the sdram's internal row buffers to act as cache hinder further latency reduction virtual channel sdramovercomes these limitations by providing set of channel buffers that can hold segments from rows of any internal sdram bank this paper presents memory controller policies that can make effective use of these channel buffers to further reduce the average read latency of the sdram
locating faults in program can be very time consuming and arduous and therefore there is an increased demand for automated techniques that can assist in the fault localization process in this paper code coverage based method with family of heuristics is proposed in order to prioritize suspicious code according to its likelihood of containing program bugs highly suspicious code ie code that is more likely to contain bug should be examined before code that is relatively less suspicious and in this manner programmers can identify and repair faulty code more efficiently and effectively we also address two important issues first how can each additional failed test case aid in locating program faults and second how can each additional successful test case help in locating program faults we propose that with respect to piece of code the contribution of the first failed test case that executes it in computing its likelihood of containing bug is larger than or equal to that of the second failed test case that executes it which in turn is larger than or equal to that of the third failed test case that executes it and so on this principle is also applied to the contribution provided by successful test cases that execute the piece of code tool gdebug was implemented to automate the computation of the suspiciousness of the code and the subsequent prioritization of suspicious code for locating program faults to validate our method case studies were performed on six sets of programs siemens suite unix suite space grep gzip and make data collected from the studies are supportive of the above claim and also suggest heuristics iii and of our method can effectively reduce the effort spent on fault localization
in order to achieve high performance wide issue superscalar processors have to fetch large number of instructions per cycle conditional branches are the primary impediment to increasing the fetch bandwidth because they can potentially alter the flow of control and are very frequent to overcome this problem these processors need to predict the outcome of multiple branches in cycle this paper investigates two control flow prediction schemes that predict the effective outcome of multiple branches with the help of single prediction instead of considering branches as the basic units of prediction these schemes consider subgraphs of the control flow graph of the executed program as the basic units of prediction and predict the target of an entire subgraph at time thereby allowing the superscalar fetch mechanism to go past multiple branches in cycle the first control flow prediction scheme investigated considers sequential block like subgraphs and the second scheme considers tree like subgraphs to make the control flow predictions both schemes do out of prediction as opposed to the out of prediction done by branch level prediction schemes these two schemes are evaluated using mips isa based way superscalar microarchitecture an improvement in effective fetch size of approximately percent and percent respectively is observed over identical microprocessors that use branch level prediction no appreciable difference in the prediction accuracy was observed although the control flow prediction schemes predicted out of outcomes
wireless mesh networks wmns are considered as cost effective easily deployable and capable of extending internet connectivity however one of the major challenges in deploying reliable wmns is preventing their nodes from malicious attacks which is of particular concern as attacks can severely degrade network performance when dos attack is targeted over an entire communication path it is called path based dos attack we study the performance impact of path based dos attacks by considering attack intensity medium errors physical diversity collusion and hop count we setup wireless mesh testbed and configure set of experiments to gather realistic measurements and assess the effects of different factors we find that medium errors have significant impact on the performance of wmns when path based dos attack is carried out and the impact is exacerbated by the mac layer retransmissions we show that due to physical diversity far attacker can lead to an increased performance degradation than close by attacker additionally we demonstrate that the joint impact of two colluding attackers is not as severe as the joint result of individual attacks we also discuss strategy to counter path based dos attacks which can potentially alleviate the impact of the attack significantly

the predictability of data values is studied at fundamental level two basic predictor models are defined computational predictors perform an operation on previous values to yield predicted next values examples we study are stride value prediction which adds delta to previous value and last value prediction which performs the trivial identity operation on the previous value context based predictors match recent value history context with previous value history and predict values based entirely on previously observed patterns to understand the potential of value prediction we perform simulations with unbounded prediction tables that are immediately updated using correct data values simulations of integer spec benchmarks show that data values can be highly predictable best performance is obtained with context based predictors overall prediction accuracies are between and the context based predictor typically has an accuracy about better than the computational predictors last value and stride comparison of context based prediction and stride prediction shows that the higher accuracy of context based prediction is due to relatively few static instructions giving large improvements this suggests the usefulness of hybrid predictors among different instruction types predictability varies significantly in general load and shift instructions are more difficult to predict correctly whereas add instructions are more predictable

as more and more documents become electronically available finding documents in large databases that fit users needs is becoming increasingly important in the past the document search problem was dealt with using the database query approach or the text based search approach in this paper we investigate this problem focusing on the sci ssci databases from isi specifically we design our search methodology based on the four fields commonly seen in scientific research document abstract title keywords and reference list of these four only the abstract field can be viewed as normal text while the other three have their own characteristics to differentiate them from texts therefore we first develop method to compute the similarity value for each field our next problem is combining the four similarity values into final value one approach is to assign weights to each and compute the weighted sum we have not adopted this simple weighting method however because it is difficult to determine appropriate weights instead we use the back propagation neural network to combine them finally extensive experiments have been carried out using real documents drawn from tkde journal and the results indicate that in all situations our method has much higher accuracy than the traditional text based search approach
denial of service dos attacks are arguably one of the most cumbersome problems in the internet this paper presents distributed information system over set of completely connected servers called chameleon which is robust to dos attacks on the nodes as well as the operations of the system in particular it allows nodes to efficiently look up and insert data items at any time despite powerful past insider adversary which has complete knowledge of the system up to some time point and can use that knowledge in order to block constant fraction of the nodes and inject lookup and insert requests to selected data this is achieved with smart randomized replication policy requiring polylogarithmic overhead only and the interplay of permanent and temporary distributed hash table all requests in chameleon can be processed in polylogarithmic time and work at every node
energy consumption is major concern in many embedded computing systems several studies have shown that cache memories account for about of the total energy consumed in these systems the performance of given cache architecture is largely determined by the behavior of the application using that cache desktop systems have to accommodate very wide range of applications and therefore the manufacturer usually sets the cache architecture as compromise given current applications technology and cost unlike desktop systems embedded systems are designed to run small range of well defined applications in this context cache architecture that is tuned for that narrow range of applications can have both increased performance as well as lower energy consumption we introduce novel cache architecture intended for embedded microprocessor platforms the cache can be configured by software to be direct mapped two way or four way set associative using technique we call way concatenation having very little size or performance overhead we show that the proposed cache architecture reduces energy caused by dynamic power compared to way shutdown cache furthermore we extend the cache architecture to also support way shutdown method designed to reduce the energy from static power that is increasing in importance in newer cmos technologies our study of programs drawn from powerstone mediabench and spec show that tuning the cache's configuration saves energy for every program compared to conventional four way set associative as well as direct mapped caches with average savings of compared to four way conventional cache

an overwhelming volume of news videos from different channels and languages is available today which demands automatic management of this abundant information to effectively search retrieve browse and track cross lingual news stories news story similarity measure plays critical role in assessing the novelty and redundancy among them in this paper we explore the novelty and redundancy detection with visual duplicates and speech transcripts for cross lingual news stories news stories are represented by sequence of keyframes in the visual track and set of words extracted from speech transcript in the audio track major difference to pure text documents is that the number of keyframes in one story is relatively small compared to the number of words and there exist large number of non near duplicate keyframes these features make the behavior of similarity measures different compared to traditional textual collections furthermore the textual features and visual features complement each other for news stories they can be further combined to boost the performance experiments on the trecvid cross lingual news video corpus show that approaches on textual features and visual features demonstrate different performance and measures on visual features are quite effective overall the cosine distance on keyframes is still robust measure language models built on visual features demonstrate promising performance the fusion of textual and visual features improves overall performance

efforts to improve application reliability can be irrelevant if the reliability of the underlying operating system on which the application resides is not seriously considered an important first step in improving the reliability of an operating system is to gain insights into why and how the bugs originate contributions of the different modules to the bugs their distribution across severities the different ways in which the bugs may be resolved and the impact of bug severities on their resolution times to acquire this insight we conducted an extensive analysis of the publicly available bug data on the linux kernel over period of seven years we also justify and explain the statistical bug occurrence trends observed from the data using the architecture of the linux kernel as an anchor the statistical analysis of the linux bug data suggests that the linux kernel may draw significant benefits from the continual reliability improvement efforts of its developers these efforts however are disproportionately targeted towards popular configurations and hardware platforms due to which the reliability of these configurations may be better than those that are not commonly used thus key finding of our study is that it may be prudent to restrict to using common configurations and platforms when using open source systems such as linux in applications with stringent reliability expectations finally our study of the architectural properties of the bugs suggests that the dependence among the modules rather than the unreliabilities of the individual modules is the primary cause of the bugs and their impact on system reliability
major obstacle in the technology transfer agenda of behavioral analysis and design methods is the need for logics or automata to express properties for control intensive systems interaction modeling notations may offer replacement or complement with practitioner appealing and lightweight flavor due partly to the subspecification of intended behavior by means of scenarios we propose novel approach consisting of engineering new formal notation of this sort based on simple compact declarative semantics vts visual timed event scenarios scenarios represent event patterns graphically depicting conditions over traces they predicate general system events and provide features to describe complex properties not expressible with msc like notations the underlying formalism supports partial orders and real time constraints the problem of checking whether timed automaton model has matching trace is proven decidable on top of this kernel we introduce notation to state properties over all system traces conditional scenarios allowing engineers to describe uniquely rich connections between antecedent and consequent portions of the scenario an undecidability result is presented for the general case of the model checking problem over dense time domains to later identify decidable yet practically relevant subclass where verification is solvable by generating antiscenarios expressed in the vts hbox rm kernel notation
data generalization is widely used to protect identities and prevent inference of sensitive information during the public release of microdata the anonymity model has been extensively applied in this context the model seeks generalization scheme such that every individual becomes indistinguishable from at least other individuals and the loss in information while doing so is kept at minimum the search is performed on domain hierarchy lattice where every node is vector signifying the level of generalization for each attribute an effort to understand privacy and data utility trade offs will require knowing the minimum possible information losses of every possible value of however this can easily lead to an exhaustive evaluation of all nodes in the hierarchy lattice in this paper we propose using the concept of pareto optimality to obtain the desired trade off information pareto optimal generalization is one in which no other generalization can provide higher value of without increasing the information loss we introduce the pareto optimal anonymization poka algorithm to traverse the hierarchy lattice and show that the number of node evaluations required to find the pareto optimal generalizations can be significantly reduced results on benchmark data set show that the algorithm is capable of identifying all pareto optimal nodes by evaluating only of nodes in the lattice
distributed simulation techniques are commonly used to improve the speed and scalability of wireless sensor network simulators however accurate simulations of dynamic interactions of sensor network applications incur large synchronization overheads and severely limit the performance of existing distributed simulators in this paper we present two novel techniques that significantly reduce such overheads by minimizing the number of sensor node synchronizations during simulations these techniques work by exploiting radio and mac specific characteristics without reducing simulation accuracy in addition we present new probing mechanism that makes it possible to exploit any potential application specific characteristics for synchronization reductions we implement and evaluate these techniques in cycle accurate distributed simulation framework that we developed based on avrora in our experiments the radio level technique achieves speedup of to times in simulating hop networks with to nodes with default backoffs themac level technique achieves speedup of to times in the best case scenarios of simulating and nodes in our multi hop flooding tests together they achieve speedup of to times in simulating networks with to nodes the experiments also demonstrate that the speedups can be significantly larger as the techniques scale with the number of processors and radio off mac backoff time
an important problem in software engineering is the automated discovery of noncrashing occasional bugs in this work we address this problem and show that mining of weighted call graphs of program executions is promising technique we mine weighted graphs with combination of structural and numerical techniques more specifically we propose novel reduction technique for call graphs which introduces edge weights then we present an analysis technique for such weighted call graphs based on graph mining and on traditional feature selection schemes the technique generalises previous graph mining approaches as it allows for an analysis of weights our evaluation shows that our approach finds bugs which previous approaches cannot detect so far our technique also doubles the precision of finding bugs which existing techniques can already localise in principle
this article presents new technique adaptive replication for automatically eliminating synchronization bottlenecks in multithreaded programs that perform atomic operations on objects synchronization bottlenecks occur when multiple threads attempt to concurrently update the same object it is often possible to eliminate synchronization bottlenecks by replicating objects each thread can then update its own local replica without synchronization and without interacting with other threads when the computation needs to access the original object it combines the replicas to produce the correct values in the original object one potential problem is that eagerly replicating all objects may lead to performance degradation and excessive memory consumptionadaptive replication eliminates unnecessary replication by dynamically detecting contention at each object to find and replicate only those objects that would otherwise cause synchronization bottlenecks we have implemented adaptive replication in the context of parallelizing compiler for subset of given an unannotated sequential program written in the compiler automatically extracts the concurrency determines when it is legal to apply adaptive replication and generates parallel code that uses adaptive replication to efficiently eliminate synchronization bottlenecksin addition to automatic parallelization and adaptive replication our compiler also implements lock coarsening transformation that increases the granularity at which the computation locks objects the advantage is reduction in the frequency with which the computation acquires and releases locks the potential disadvantage is the introduction of new synchronization bottlenecks caused by increases in the sizes of the critical sections because the adaptive replication transformation takes place at lock acquisition sites there is synergistic interaction between lock coarsening and adaptive replication lock coarsening drives down the overhead of using adaptive replication and adaptive replication eliminates synchronization bottlenecks associated with the overaggressive use of lock coarseningour experimental results show that for our set of benchmark programs the combination of lock coarsening and adaptive replication can eliminate synchronization bottlenecks and significantly reduce the synchronization and replication overhead as compared to versions that use none or only one of the transformations
in this paper we investigate reduced representations for the emerging cube we use the borders classical in data mining for the emerging cube these borders can support classification tasks to know whether trend is emerging or not however the borders do not make possible to retrieve the measure values this is why we introduce two new and reduced representations without measure loss the emerging closed cube and emerging quotient cube we state the relationship between the introduced representations experiments performed on various data sets are intended to measure the size of the three reduced representations

one popular approach to object design proposes to identify responsibilities from software contracts apply number of principles to assign them to objects and finally construct an object interaction that realizes the contract this three step activity is currently manual process that is time consuming and error prone and is among the most challenging activities in object oriented development in this paper we present model transformation that partially automates this activity such transformation is modularized in three stages the first stage automatically transforms software contract to trace of state modification actions in the second stage the designer manually extends the trace with design decisions finally the extended trace is automatically transformed to an object interaction in the third stage prototype of the whole transformation was developed and successfully applied to case study from the literature our technique allows the extraction of valuable information from software contracts provides bridge between analysis and design artifacts and significantly reduces the effort of interaction design
operational transformation ot is an optimistic concurrency control method that has been well established in realtime group editors and has drawn significant research attention in the past decade it is generally believed that the use of ot automatically achieves high local responsiveness in group editors however no performance study has been reported previously on ot algorithms to the best of our knowledge this paper extends recent ot algorithm and studies its performance by theoretical analyses and performance experiments this paper proves that the worst case execution time of ot only appears in rare cases and shows that local responsiveness of ot based group editors in fact depends on number of factors such as the size of the operation log the paper also reveals that these two results have general implications on ot algorithms and hence the design of ot based group editors must pay attention to performance issues
addressed in this paper is the issue of email data cleaning for text mining many text mining applications need take emails as input email data is usually noisy and thus it is necessary to clean it before mining several products offer email cleaning features however the types of noises that can be eliminated are restricted despite the importance of the problem email cleaning has received little attention in the research community thorough and systematic investigation on the issue is thus needed in this paper email cleaning is formalized as problem of non text filtering and text normalization in this way email cleaning becomes independent from any specific text mining processing cascaded approach is proposed which cleans up an email in four passes including non text filtering paragraph normalization sentence normalization and word normalization as far as we know non text filtering and paragraph normalization have not been investigated previously methods for performing the tasks on the basis of support vector machines svm have also been proposed in this paper features in the models have been defined experimental results indicate that the proposed svm based methods can significantly outperform the baseline methods for email cleaning the proposed method has been applied to term extraction typical text mining processing experimental results show that the accuracy of term extraction can be significantly improved by using the data cleaning method
due to the reliance on the textual information associated with an image image search engines on the web lack the discriminative power to deliver visually diverse search results the textual descriptions are key to retrieve relevant results for given user query but at the same time provide little information about the rich image content in this paper we investigate three methods for visual diversification of image search results the methods deploy lightweight clustering techniques in combination with dynamic weighting function of the visual features to best capture the discriminative aspects of the resulting set of images that is retrieved representative image is selected from each cluster which together form diverse result set based on performance evaluation we find that the outcome of the methods closely resembles human perception of diversity which was established in an extensive clustering experiment carried out by human assessors
inspired by the surprising discovery of several recurring structures in various complex networks in recent years number of related works treated software systems as complex network and found that software systems might expose the small world effects and follow scale free degree distributions different from the research perspectives adopted in these works the work presented in this paper treats software execution processes as an evolving complex network for the first time the concept of software mirror graph is introduced as new model of complex networks to incorporate the dynamic information of software behavior the experimentation paradigm with statistical repeatability was applied to three distinct subject programs to conduct several software experiments the corresponding experimental results are analyzed by treating the software execution processes as an evolving directed topological graph as well as an evolving software mirror graph this results in several new findings while the software execution processes may demonstrate as small world complex network in the topological sense they no longer expose the small world effects in the temporal sense further the degree distributions of the software execution processes may follow power law however they may also follow an exponential function or piecewise power law

dynamic slicing algorithms have been considered to aid in debugging for many years however as far as we know no detailed studies on evaluating the benefits of using dynamic slicing for locating real faults present in programs have been carried out in this paper we study the effectiveness of fault location using dynamic slicing for set of real bugs reported in some widely used software programs our results show that of the faults studied faults were captured by data slices required the use of full slices and none of them required the use of relevant slices moreover it was observed that dynamic slicing considerably reduced the subset of program statements that needed to be examined to locate faulty statements interestingly we observed that all of the memory bugs in the faulty versions were captured by data slices the dynamic slices that captured faulty code included to of statements that were executed at least once
video on demand vod service offers large selection of videos from which customers can choose designers of vod systems strive to achieve low access latency for customers one approach that has been investigated by several researchers allows the server to batch clients requesting the same video and to serve clients in the same batch with one multicast video stream this approach has the advantage that it can save server resources as well as server access and network bandwidth thus allowing the server to handle large number of customers without sacrificing access latency vod server replication is another approach that can allow vod service to handle large number of clients albeit at the additional cost of providing more servers while replication is an effective way to increase the service capacity it needs to be coupled with appropriate selection techniques in order to make efficient use of the increased capacity in this paper we investigate the design of server selection techniques for system of replicated batching vod servers we design and evaluate range of selection algorithms as they would be applied to three batching approaches batching with persistent channel allocation patching and hierarchical multicast stream merging hmsm we demonstrate that server replication combined with appropriate server selection scheme can indeed be used to increase the capacity of the service leading to improved performance
this work addresses data warehouse maintenance ie how changes to autonomous heterogeneous and distributed sources should be detected and propagated to warehouse the research community has mainly addressed issues relating to the internal operation of data warehouse servers work related to data warehouse maintenance has received less attention and only limited set of maintenance alternatives are considered while ignoring the autonomy and heterogeneity of sourcesin this paper we extend work on single source view maintenance to views with multiple heterogeneous sources we present tool pam which allows for comparison of large number of relevant maintenance policies under different configurations based on such analysis and previous studies we propose set of heuristics to guide in policy selection the quality of these heuristics is evaluated empirically using test bed developed for this purpose this is done for number of different criteria and for different data sources and computer systems the performance gained using the policy selected through the heuristics is compared with the performance of all identified policies based on these experiments we claim that heuristic based selections are good
massive data streams are now fundamental to many data processing applications for example internet routers produce large scale diagnostic data streams such streams are rarely stored in traditional databases and instead must be processed on the fly as they are produced similarly sensor networks produce multiple data streams of observations from their sensors there is growing focus on manipulating data streams and hence there is need to identify basic operations of interest in managing data streams and to support them efficiently we propose computation of the hamming norm as basic operation of interest the hamming norm formalises ideas that are used throughout data processing when applied to single stream the hamming norm gives the number of distinct items that are present in that data stream which is statistic of great interest in databases when applied to pair of streams the hamming norm gives an important measure of dis similarity the number of unequal item counts in the two streams hamming norms have many uses in comparing data streams we present novel approximation technique for estimating the hamming norm for massive data streams this relies on what we call the sketch and we prove its accuracy we test our approximation method on large quantity of synthetic and real stream data and show that the estimation is accurate to within few percentage points
we present framework for specification and security analysis of communication protocols for mobile wireless networks this setting introduces new challenges which are not being addressed by classical protocol analysis techniques the main complication stems from the fact that the actions of intermediate nodes and their connectivity can no longer be abstracted into single unstructured adversarial environment as they form an inherent part of the system's security in order to model this scenario faithfully we present broadcast calculus which makes clear distinction between the protocol processes and the network's connectivity graph which may change independently from protocol actions we identify property characterising an important aspect of security in this setting and express it using behavioural equivalences of the calculus we complement this approach with control flow analysis which enables us to automatically check this property on given network and attacker specification
characterizing the communication behavior of large scale applications is difficult and costly task due to code system complexity and long execution times while many tools to study this behavior have been developed these approaches either aggregate information in lossy way through high level statistics or produce huge trace files that are hard to handle we contribute an approach that provides orders of magnitude smaller if not near constant size communication traces regardless of the number of nodes while preserving structural information we introduce intra and inter node compression techniques of mpi events that are capable of extracting an application's communication structure we further present replay mechanism for the traces generated by our approach and discuss results of our implementation for bluegene given this novel capability we discuss its impact on communication tuning and beyond to the best of our knowledge such concise representation of mpi traces in scalable manner combined with deterministic mpi call replay is without any precedent

the web graph is giant social network whose properties have been measured and modeled extensively in recent years most such studies concentrate on the graph structure alone and do not consider textual properties of the nodes consequently web communities have been characterized purely in terms of graph structure and not on page content we propose that topic taxonomy such as yahoo or the open directory provides useful framework for understanding the structure of content based clusters and communities in particular using topic taxonomy and an automatic classifier we can measure the background distribution of broad topics on the web and analyze the capability of recent random walk algorithms to draw samples which follow such distributions in addition we can measure the probability that page about one broad topic will link to another broad topic extending this experiment we can measure how quickly topic context is lost while walking randomly on the web graph estimates of this topic mixing distance may explain why global pagerank is still meaningful in the context of broad queries in general our measurements may prove valuable in the design of community specific crawlers and link based ranking systems
current techniques and tools for automated termination analysis of term rewrite systems trss are already very powerful however they fail for algorithms whose termination is essentially due to an inductive argument therefore we show how to couple the dependency pair method for trs termination with inductive theorem proving as confirmed by the implementation of our new approach in the tool aprove now trs termination techniques are also successful on this important class of algorithms
we present freeform modeling framework for unstructured triangle meshes which is based on constraint shape optimization the goal is to simplify the user interaction even for quite complex freeform or multiresolution modifications the user first sets various boundary constraints to define custom tailored abstract basis function which is adjusted to given design task the actual modification is then controlled by moving one single dof manipulator object the technique can handle arbitrary support regions and piecewise boundary conditions with smoothness ranging continuously from to to more naturally adapt the modification to the shape of the support region the deformed surface can be tuned to bend with anisotropic stiffness we are able to achieve real time response in an interactive design session even for complex meshes by precomputing set of scalar valued basis functions that correspond to the degrees of freedom of the manipulator by which the user controls the modification

with the diverse new capabilities that sensor and ad hoc networks can provide applicability of data aggregation is growing data aggregation is useful in dealing with multi value domain information which often requires approximate agreement decisions among nodes in contrast to fully connected networks the research on data aggregation for partially connected networks is very limited this is due to the complexity of formal proofs and the fact that node may not have global view of the entire network which makes it difficult to attain the convergence properties the complexity of the problem is compounded in the presence of message dropouts faults and orchestrated attacks by exploiting the properties of discrete markov chains this study investigates the data aggregation problem for partially connected networks to obtain the number of rounds of message exchanges needed to reach network convergence the average convergence rate in round of message exchange and the number of rounds required to reach stationary convergence

recently the network attached secure disk nasd model has become more widely used technique for constructing large scale storage systems however the security system proposed for nasd assumes that each client will contact the server to get capability to access one object on server while this approach works well in smaller scale systems in which each file is composed of few objects it fails for large scale systems in which thousands of clients make accesses to single file composed of thousands of objects spread across thousands of disks the file system we are building ceph distributes files across many objects and disks to distribute load and improve reliability in such system the metadata server cluster will sometimes see thousands of open requests for the same file within seconds to address this bottleneck we propose new authentication protocols for object based storage systems in which sequence of fixed size objects comprise file and flash crowds are likely we qualitatively evaluated the security and risks of each protocol and using traces of scientific application compared the overhead of each protocol we found that surprisingly protocol using public key cryptography incurred little extra cost while providing greater security than protocol using only symmetric key cryptography
this paper presents flickr distance which is novel measurement of the relationship between semantic concepts objects scenes in visual domain for each concept collection of images are obtained from flickr based on which the improved latent topic based visual language model is built to capture the visual characteristic of this concept then flickr distance between different concepts is measured by the square root of jensen shannon js divergence between the corresponding visual language models comparing with wordnet flickr distance is able to handle far more concepts existing on the web and it can scale up with the increase of concept vocabularies comparing with google distance which is generated in textual domain flickr distance is more precise for visual domain concepts as it captures the visual relationship between the concepts instead of their co occurrence in text search results besides unlike google distance flickr distance satisfies triangular inequality which makes it more reasonable distance metric both subjective user study and objective evaluation show that flickr distance is more coherent to human perception than google distance we also design several application scenarios such as concept clustering and image annotation to demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed distance in image related applications
lifetime is very important to wireless sensor networks since most sensors are equipped with non rechargeable batteries therefore energy and delay are critical issues for the research of sensor networks that have limited lifetime due to the uncertainties in execution time of some tasks this paper models each varied execution time as probabilistic random variable with the consideration of applications performance requirements to solve the map mode assignment with probability problem using probabilistic design we propose an optimal algorithm to minimize the total energy consumption while satisfying the timing constraint with guaranteed confidence probability the experimental results show that our approach achieves significant energy saving than previous work for example our algorithm achieves an average improvement of on total energy consumption

miniaturization of devices and the ensuing decrease in the threshold voltage has led to substantial increase in the leakage component of the total processor energy consumption relatively simpler issue logic and the presence of large number of function units in the vliw and the clustered vliw architectures attribute large fraction of this leakage energy consumption in the functional units however functional units are not fully utilized in the vliw architectures because of the inherent variations in the ilp of the programs this underutilization is even more pronounced in the context of clustered vliw architectures because of the contentions for the limited number of slow intercluster communication channels which lead to many short idle cyclesin the past some architectural schemes have been proposed to obtain leakage energy bene ts by aggressively exploiting the idleness of functional units however presence of many short idle cycles cause frequent transitions from the active mode to the sleep mode and vice versa and adversely ffects the energy benefits of purely hardware based scheme in this paper we propose and evaluate compiler instruction scheduling algorithm that assist such hardware based scheme in the context of vliw and clustered vliw architectures the proposed scheme exploits the scheduling slacks of instructions to orchestrate the functional unit mapping with the objective of reducing the number of transitions in functional units thereby keeping them off for longer duration the proposed compiler assisted scheme obtains further reduction of energy consumption of functional units with negligible performance degradation over hardware only scheme for vliw architecture the benefits are and in the context of clustered and clustered vliw architecture respectively our test bed uses the trimaran compiler infrastructure
despite well documented advantages attempts to go truly paperless seldom succeed this is principally because computer based paperless systems typically do not support all of the affordances of paper nor the work process that have evolved with paper based systems we suggest that attention to users work environments activities and practices are critical to the success of paperless systems this paper describes the development and effective utilization of software tool for the paperless marking of student assignments which does not require users to compromise on established best practice it includes significant advance in the task management support
clustering decisions frequently arise in business applications such as recommendations concerning products markets human resources etc currently decision makers must analyze diverse algorithms and parameters on an individual basis in order to establish preferences on the decision making issues they face because there is no supportive model or tool which enables comparing different result clusters generated by these algorithms and parameters combinations the multi algorithm voting mav methodology enables not only visualization of results produced by diverse clustering algorithms but also provides quantitative analysis of the results the current research applies mav methodology to the case of recommending new car pricing the findings illustrate the impact and the benefits of such decision support system

most real world databases contain substantial amounts of time referenced or temporal data recent advances in temporal query languages show that such database applications may benefit substantially from built in temporal support in the dbms to achieve this temporal query representation optimization and processing mechanisms must be provided this paper presents foundation for query optimization that integrates conventional and temporal query optimization and is suitable for both conventional dbms architectures and ones where the temporal support is obtained via layer on top of conventional dbms this foundation captures duplicates and ordering for all queries as well as coalescing for temporal queries thus generalizing all existing approaches known to the authors it includes temporally extended relational algebra to which sql and temporal sql queries may be mapped six types of algebraic equivalences concrete query transformation rules that obey different equivalences procedure for determining which types of transformation rules are applicable for optimizing query and query plan enumeration algorithm the presented approach partitions the work required by the database implementor to develop provably correct query optimizer into four stages the database implementor has to specify operations formally design and prove correct appropriate transformation rules that satisfy any of the six equivalence types augment the mechanism that determines when the different types of rules are applicable to ensure that the enumeration algorithm applies the rules correctly and ensure that the mapping generates correct initial query plan
queries over sets of complex elements are performed extracting features from each element which are used in place of the real ones during the processing extracting large number of significant features increases the representative power of the feature vector and improves the query precision however each feature is dimension in the representation space consequently handling more features worsen the dimensionality curse the problem derives from the fact that the elements tends to distribute all over the space and large dimensionality allows them to spread over much broader spaces therefore in high dimensional spaces elements are frequently farther from each other so the distance differences among pairs of elements tends to homogenize when searching for nearest neighbors the first one is usually not close but as long as one is found small increases in the query radius tend to include several others this effect increases the overlap between nodes in access methods indexing the dataset both spatial and metric access methods are sensitive to the problem this paper presents general strategy applicable to metric access methods in general improving the performance of similarity queries in high dimensional spaces our technique applies function that stretches the distances thus close objects become closer and far ones become even farther experiments using the metric access method slim tree show that similarity queries performed in the transformed spaces demands up to less distance calculations less disk access and reduces up to in total time when comparing with the original spaces
differential calculus for first order logic is developed to enforce database integrity formal differentiation of first order sentences is useful in maintaining database integrity since once database constraint is expressed as first order sentence its derivative with respect to transaction provides the necessary and sufficient condition for maintaining integrity the derivative is often much simpler to test than the original constraint since it maintains integrity differentially by assuming integrity before the transaction and testing only for new violations the formal differentiation requires no resolution search but only substitution it is more efficient than resolution based approaches and it provides considerably more general solution than previous substitution based methods since it is valid for all first order sentences and with all transactions involving arbitrary collections of atomic changes to the database it also produces large number of sufficient conditions that are often less strict than those of the previous approaches and it can be extended to accommodate many dynamic constraints

theoretical and technological progress has revived the interest in the design of services for the support of co located human human communication and collaboration witnessing the start of several large scale projects over the last few years most of these projects focus on meetings and or lecture situations however user centred design and evaluation frameworks for co located communication and collaboration are major concern in this paper we summarise the prevalent approaches towards user centred design and evaluation and we develop two different services in one service participants in small group meeting receive real time feedback about observable properties of the meeting that are directly related to the social dynamics such as individual amount of speaking time or eye gaze patterns in the other service teachers in classroom receive real time feedback about the activities and attention level of participants in the lecture we also propose ways to address the different dimensions that are relevant to the design and evaluation of these services the individual the social and the organisational dimension bringing together methods from different disciplines
the specification of an information system should include description of structural system aspects as well as description of the system behavior in this article we show how this can be achieved by high level petri nets mdash namely the so called nr nets nested relation transition nets in nr nets the structural part is modeled by nested relations and the behavioral part is modeled by novel petri net formalism each place of net represents nested relation scheme and the marking of each place is given as nested relation of the respective type insert and delete operations in nested relational database nf database are expressed by transitions in net these operations may operate not only on whole tuples of given relation but also on ldquo subtuples rdquo of existing tuples the arcs of net are inscribed with so called filter tables which allow together with an optional logical expression as transition inscription conditions to be formulated on the specified sub tuples the occurrence rule for nr net transitions is defined by the operations union intersection and ldquo negative rdquo in lattices of nested relations the structure of an nr net together with the occurrence rule defines classes of possible information system procedures ie sequences of possibly concurrent operations in an information system

semi supervised support vector machine svm attempts to learn decision boundary that traverses through low data density regions by maximizing the margin over labeled and unlabeled examples traditionally svm is formulated as non convex integer programming problem and is thus difficult to solve in this paper we propose the cutting plane semi supervised support vector machine cutsvm algorithm to solve the svm problem specifically we construct nested sequence of successively tighter relaxations of the original svm problem and each optimization problem in this sequence could be efficiently solved using the constrained concave convex procedure cccp moreover we prove theoretically that the cutsvm algorithm takes time sn to converge with guaranteed accuracy where is the total number of samples in the dataset and is the average number of non zero features ie the sparsity experimental evaluations on several real world datasets show that cutsvm performs better than existing svm methods both in efficiency and accuracy

in this paper we consider the problem of maximizing wireless network capacity aka one shot scheduling in both the protocol and physical models we give the first distributed algorithms with provable guarantees in the physical model and show how they can be generalized to more complicated metrics and settings in which the physical assumptions are slightly violated we also give the first algorithms in the protocol model that do not assume transmitters can coordinate with their neighbors in the interference graph so every transmitter chooses whether to broadcast based purely on local events our techniques draw heavily from algorithmic game theory and machine learning theory even though our goal is distributed algorithm indeed our main results allow every transmitter to run any algorithm it wants so long as its algorithm has learning theoretic property known as no regret in game theoretic setting
in previous paper we introduced hybrid scalable approach for data gathering and dissemination in sensor networks we called on board data dissemination obdd the approach was validated and implemented on well structured network topologies where virtual boards carry the queries are constructed guided by well defined trajectories in this paper we extend our previous work to include networks with irregular topologies in such networks boards guided by well defined trajectories are no longer enough to construct the dissemination structure we have adapted and modified an underlying topology detection algorithm to fit our protocol the resulting topology based on board data dissemination tobdd efficiently works with any network topology it also maintains the desirable features of obdd although the approach adapts both pull and push strategies it synchronizes both phases to maintain the communications mainly on demand and to prohibit problems that could be inherited from the push strategy both analysis and simulation show that tobdd promises an efficient and scalable paradigm for data gathering and dissemination in sensor networks that reduces the communication cost and leads to load balancing
several recent studies have introduced lightweight versions of java reduced languages in which complex features like threads and reflection are dropped to enable rigorous arguments about key properties such as type safety we carry this process step further omitting almost all features of the full language including interfaces and even assignment to obtain small calculus featherweight java for which rigorous proofs are not only possible but easy featherweight java bears similar relation to java as the lambda calculus does to languages such as ml and haskell it offers similar computational feel providing classes methods fields inheritance and dynamic typecasts with semantics closely following java's proof of type safety for featherweight java thus illustrates many of the interesting features of safety proof for the full language while remaining pleasingly compact the minimal syntax typing rules and operational semantics of featherweight java make it handy tool for studying the consequences of extensions and variations as an illustration of its utility in this regard we extend featherweight java with generic classes in the style of gj bracha odersky stoutamire and wadler and give detailed proof of type safety the extended system formalizes for the first time some of the key features of gj
memory analysis techniques have become sophisticated enough to model with high degree of accuracy the manipulation of simple memory structures finite structures single double linked lists and trees however modern programming languages provide extensive library support including wide range of generic collection objects that make use of complex internal data structures while these data structures ensure that the collections are efficient often these representations cannot be effectively modeled by existing methods either due to excessive analysis runtime or due to the inability to represent the required information this paper presents method to represent collections using an abstraction of their semantics the construction of the abstract semantics for the collection objects is done in manner that allows individual elements in the collections to be identified our construction also supports iterators over the collections and is able to model the position of the iterators with respect to the elements in the collection by ordering the contents of the collection based on the iterator position the model can represent notion of progress when iteratively manipulating the contents of collection these features allow strong updates to the individual elements in the collection as well as strong updates over the collections themselves

given that contiguous reads and writes between cache and disk outperform fragmented reads and writes fragmented reads and writes are forcefully transformed into contiguous reads and writes via proposed matrix stripe cache based contiguity transform msc ct method which employs rule of consistency for data integrity at the block level and rule of performance that ensures no performance degradation msc ct performs for reads and writes both of which are produced by write requests from host as write request from host employs reads for parity update and writes to disks in redundant array of independent disks raid msc ct is compatible with existing disk technologies the proposed implementation in linux kernel delivers peak throughput that is times higher than case without msc ct on representative workloads the results demonstrate that msc ct is extremely simple to implement has low overhead and is ideally suited for raid controllers not only for random writes but also for sequential writes in various realistic scenarios
although unit tests are recognized as an important tool in software development programmers prefer to write code rather than unit tests despite the emergence of tools like junit which automate part of the process unit testing remains time consuming resource intensive and not particularly appealing activitythis paper introduces new development method called contract driven development this development method is based on novel mechanism that extracts test cases from failure producing runs that the programmers trigger it exploits actions that developers perform anyway as part of their normal process of writing code thus it takes the task of writing unit tests off the developers shoulders while still taking advantage of their knowledge of the intended semantics and structure of the code the approach is based on the presence of contracts in code which act as the oracle of the test cases the test cases are extracted completely automatically are run in the background and can easily be maintained over versions the tool implementing this methodology is called cdd and is available both in binary and in source form
as the width of the processor grows complexity of register file rf with multiple ports grows more than linearly and leads to larger register access time and higher power consumption analysis of spec programs reveals that only small portion of the instructions in program in integer and in floating point require both the source operands also when the programs are executed in an wide processor only very few two or less two source instructions are executed in cycle for significant portion of time more than for integer and for floating point leading to significant under utilization of register port bandwidth in this paper we propose novel technique to significantly reduce the number of register ports with very minor modification in the select logic to issue only limited number of two source instructions each cycle this is achieved with no significant impact on processor's overall performance the novelty of the technique is that it is easy to implement and succeeds in reducing the access time power and area of the register file without aggravating these factors in any other logic on the chip with this technique in an wide processor as compared to conventional entry rf with read ports for integer programs register file can be designed with or read ports as these configurations result in instructions per cycle ipc degradation of only and respectively this significantly low degradation in ipc is achieved while reducing the register access time by and respectively and reducing power by and respectively for fp programs register file can be designed with read ports ipc loss less access time and less power or with read ports ipc loss less access time and less power the paper analyzes the performance of all the possible flavors of the proposed technique for register file in both wide and wide processors and presents choice of the performance and register port complexity combination to the designer
in this paper we propose new and general preprocessor algorithm called csroulette which converts any cost insensitive classification algorithms into cost sensitive ones csroulette is based on cost proportional roulette sampling technique called cprs in short csroulette is closely related to costing another cost sensitive meta learning algorithm which is based on rejection sampling unlike rejection sampling which produces smaller samples cprs can generate different size samples to further improve its performance we apply ensemble bagging on cprs the resulting algorithm is called csroulette our experiments show that csroulette outperforms costing and other meta learning methods in most datasets tested in addition we investigate the effect of various sample sizes and conclude that reduced sample sizes as in rejection sampling cannot be compensated by increasing the number of bagging iterations

when web user's underlying information need is not clearly specified from the initial query an effective approach is to diversify the results retrieved for this query in this paper we introduce novel probabilistic framework for web search result diversification which explicitly accounts for the various aspects associated to an underspecified query in particular we diversify document ranking by estimating how well given document satisfies each uncovered aspect and the extent to which different aspects are satisfied by the ranking as whole we thoroughly evaluate our framework in the context of the diversity task of the trec web track moreover we exploit query reformulations provided by three major web search engines wses as means to uncover different query aspects the results attest the effectiveness of our framework when compared to state of the art diversification approaches in the literature additionally by simulating an upper bound query reformulation mechanism from official trec data we draw useful insights regarding the effectiveness of the query reformulations generated by the different wses in promoting diversity
we consider the problem to infer concise document type definition dtd for given set of xml documents problem which basically reduces to learning of concise regular expressions from positive example strings we identify two such classes single occurrence regular expressions sores and chain regular expressions chares both classes capture the far majority of the regular expressions occurring in practical dtds and are succinct by definition we present the algorithm idtd infer dtd that learns sores from strings by first inferring an automaton by known techniques and then translating that automaton to corresponding sore possibly by repairing the automaton when no equivalent sore can be found in the process we introduce novel automaton to regular expression rewrite technique which is of independent interest we show that idtd outperforms existing systems in accuracy conciseness and speed in scenario where only very small amount of xml data is available for instance when generated by web service requests or by answers to queries idtd produces regular expressions which are too specific therefore we introduce novel learning algorithm crx that directly infers chares which form subclass of sores without going through an automaton representation we show that crx performs very well within its target class on very small data sets finally we discuss incremental computation noise numerical predicates and the generation of xml schemas

this paper presents the design and implementation of compiler that translates programs written in type safe subset of the programming language into highly optimized dec alpha assembly language programs and certifier that automatically checks the type safety and memory safety of any assembly language program produced by the compiler the result of the certifier is either formal proof of type safety or counterexample pointing to potential violation of the type system by the target program the ensemble of the compiler and the certifier is called certifying compilerseveral advantages of certifying compilation over previous approaches can be claimed the notion of certifying compiler is significantly easier to employ than formal compiler verification in part because it is generally easier to verify the correctness of the result of computation than to prove the correctness of the computation itself also the approach can be applied even to highly optimizing compilers as demonstrated by the fact that our compiler generates target code for range of realistic programs which is competitive with both the cc and gcc compilers with all optimizations enabled the certifier also drastically improves the effectiveness of compiler testing because for each test case it statically signals compilation errors that might otherwise require many executions to detect finally this approach is practical way to produce the safety proofs for proof carrying code system and thus may be useful in system for safe mobile code

establishing pairwise keys for each pair of neighboring sensors is the first concern in securing communication in sensor networks this task is challenging because resources are limited several random key predistribution schemes have been proposed but they are appropriate only when sensors are uniformly distributed with high density these schemes also suffer from dramatic degradation of security when the number of compromised sensors exceeds threshold in this paper we present group based key predistribution scheme gke which enables any pair of neighboring sensors to establish unique pairwise key regardless of sensor density or distribution since pairwise keys are unique security in gke degrades gracefully as the number of compromised nodes increases in addition gke is very efficient since it requires only localized communication to establish pairwise keys thus significantly reducing the communication overhead our security analysis and performance evaluation illustrate the superiority of gke in terms of resilience connectivity communication overhead and memory requirement
we present particle based method for viscoelastic fluids simulation in the method based on the traditional navier stokes equation an additional elastic stress term is introduced to achieve viscoelastic flow behaviors which have both fluid and solid features benefiting from the lagrangian nature of smoothed particle hydrodynamics large flow deformation can be handled more easily and naturally and also by changing the viscosity and elastic stress coefficient of the particles according to the temperature variation the melting and flowing phenomena such as lava flow and wax melting are achieved the temperature evolution is determined with the heat diffusion equation the method is effective and efficient and has good controllability different kinds of viscoelastic fluid behaviors can be obtained easily by adjusting the very few experimental parameters
to address business requirements and to survive in competing markets companies or open source organizations often have to release different versions of their projects in different languages manually migrating projects from one language to another such as from java to is tedious and error prone task to reduce manual effort or human errors tools can be developed for automatic migration of projects from one language to another however these tools require the knowledge of how application programming interfaces apis of one language are mapped to apis of the other language referred to as api mapping relations in this paper we propose novel approach called mam mining api mapping that mines api mapping relations from one language to another using api client code mam accepts set of projects each with two versions in two languages and mines api mapping relations between those two languages based on how apis are used by the two versions these mined api mapping relations assist in migration of projects from one language to another we implemented tool and conducted two evaluations to show the effectiveness of mam the results show that our tool mines unique mapping relations of apis between java and with more than accuracy the results also show that mined api mapping relations help reduce compilation errors and defects during migration of projects with an existing migration tool called javacsharp the reduction in compilation errors and defects is due to our new mined mapping relations that are not available with the existing migration tool
this research reports on study of the interplay between multi tasking and collaborative work we conducted an ethnographic study in two different companies where we observed the experiences and practices of thirty six information workers we observed that people continually switch between different collaborative contexts throughout their day we refer to activities that are thematically connected as working spheres we discovered that to multi task and cope with the resulting fragmentation of their work individuals constantly renew overviews of their working spheres they strategize how to manage transitions between contexts and they maintain flexible foci among their different working spheres we argue that system design to support collaborative work should include the notion that people are involved in multiple collaborations with contexts that change continually system design must take into account these continual changes people switch between local and global perspectives of their working spheres have varying states of awareness of their different working spheres and are continually managing transitions between contexts due to interruptions
the growing cost of tuning and managing computer systems is leading to out sourcing of commercial services to hosting centers these centers provision thousands of dense servers within relatively small real estate in order to host the applications services of different customers who may have been assured by service level agreement sla power consumption of these servers is becoming serious concern in the design and operation of the hosting centers the effects of high power consumption manifest not only in the costs spent in designing effective cooling systems to ward off the generated heat but in the cost of electricity consumption itself it is crucial to deploy power management strategies in these hosting centers to lower these costs towards enhancing profitability at the same time techniques for power management that include shutting down these servers and or modulating their operational speed can impact the ability of the hosting center to meet slas in addition repeated on off cycles can increase the wear and tear of server components incurring costs for their procurement and replacement this paper presents formalism to this problem and proposes three new online solution strategies based on steady state queuing analysis feedback control theory and hybrid mechanism borrowing ideas from these two using real web server traces we show that these solutions are more adaptive to workload behavior when performing server provisioning and speed control than earlier heuristics towards minimizing operational costs while meeting the slas
in this article we present synthesis technique for generating schedulers for real time systems the aim of the scheduler is to ensure via restricting the general behaviour that the real time system satisfies the specification the real time system and the specification are described as alur dill timed automata while the synthesised scheduler is type of timed trajectory automaton this allows us to perform the synthesis without incurring the cost of constructing timed regions we also note simple constraint that the specification has to satisfy for this technique to be useful
one important trend in today's microprocessor architectures is the increase in size of the processor caches these caches also tend to be set associative as technology scales process variations are expected to increase the fault rates of the sram cells that compose such caches as an important component of the processor the parametric yield of sram cells is crucial to the overall performance and yield of the microchip in this article we propose microarchitectural solution called the buddy cache that permits large set associative caches to tolerate faults in sram cells due to process variations in essence instead of disabling faulty cache block in set as is the current practice it is paired with another faulty cache block in the same set mdash the buddy although both cache blocks are faulty if the faults of the two blocks do not overlap then instead of losing two blocks buddying will yield functional block from the nonfaulty portions of the two blocks we found that with buddying caches can better mitigate the negative impacts of process variations on performance and yield gracefully downgrading performance as opposed to catastrophic failure we will describe the details of the buddy cache and give insights as to why it is both more performance and yield resilient to faults

we propose novel partition path based ppb grouping strategy to store compressed xml data in stream of blocks in addition we employ minimal indexing scheme called block statistic signature bss on the compressed data which is simple but effective technique to support evaluation of selection and aggregate xpath queries of the compressed data we present formal analysis and empirical study of these techniques the bss indexing is first extended into effective cluster statistic signature css and multiple cluster statistic signature mss indexing by establishing more layers of indexes we analyze how the response time is affected by various parameters involved in our compression strategy such as the data stream block size the number of cluster layers and the query selectivity we also gain further insight about the compression and querying performance by studying the optimal block size in stream which leads to the minimum processing cost for queries the cost model analysis provides solid foundation for predicting the querying performance finally we demonstrate that our ppb grouping and indexing strategies are not only efficient enough to support path based selection and aggregate queries of the compressed xml data but they also require relatively low computation time and storage space when compared with other state of the art compression strategies
logic programs under answer set semantics constitute an important tool for declarative problem solving in recent years two research issues received growing attention on the one hand concepts like loops and elementary sets have been proposed in order to extend clark's completion for computing answer sets of logic programs by means of propositional logic on the other hand different concepts of program equivalence like strong and uniform equivalence have been studied in the context of program optimization and modular programming in this paper we bring these two lines of research together and provide alternative characterizations for different conceptions of equivalence in terms of unfounded sets along with the related concepts of loops and elementary sets our results yield new insights into the model theory of equivalence checking we further exploit these characterizations to develop novel encodings of program equivalence in terms of standard and quantified propositional logic respectively
the acoustic ensbox is an embedded platform which enables practical distributed acoustic sensing by providing integrated hardware and software support in single platform it provides highly accurate acoustic self calibration system which eliminates the need for manual surveying of node reference positions in this paper we present an acoustic laptop that enables distributed acoustic research through the use of less resource constrained and more readily available platform it runs exactly the same software and uses the same sensor hardware as the acoustic ensbox but replaces the embedded computing platform with standard laptop we describe the advantages of using the acoustic laptop as rich prototyping platform for acoustic source localization and mote class node localization applications the acoustic laptop is not intended to replace the acoustic ensbox but to compliment it by providing an easily replicated prototyping platform that is extensible and resource rich and suitable for attended pilot deployments we show that the benefits gained by laptop's extra resources enable intensive signal processing in real time without optimization this enables on line interactive experimentation with algorithms such as approximated maximum likelihood applications developed using the acoustic laptop can subsequently be run on the more deployable acoustic ensbox platform unmodified apart from performance optimizations
in this paper we try to conclude what kind of computer architecture is efficient for executing sequential problems and what kind of an architecture is efficient for executing parallel problems from the processor architect's point of view for that purpose we analytically evaluate the performance of eight general purpose processor architectures representing widely both commercial and scientific processor designs in both single processor and multiprocessor setups the results are interesting the most efficient architecture for sequential problems is two level pipelined vliw very long instruction word architecture with few parallel functional units the most efficient architecture for parallel problems is deeply inter thread superpipelined architecture in which functional units are chained thus designing computer for efficient sequential computation leads to very different architecture than designing one for efficient parallel computation and there exists no single optimal architecture for general purpose computation

major performance bottleneck for database systems is the memory hierarchy the performance of the memory hierarchy is directly related to how the content of disk pages maps to the cache lines ie to the organization of data within disk page called the page layout the prevalent page layout in database systems is the ary storage model nsm as demonstrated in this paper using nsm for temporal data deteriorates memory hierarchy performance for query intensive workloads this paper proposes two cacheconscious read optimized page layouts for temporal data experiments show that the proposed page layouts are substantially faster than nsm
in modern software development regression tests are used to confirm the fundamental functionalities of an edited program and to assure the code quality difficulties occur when testing reveals unexpected behaviors which indicate potential defects introduced by the edit however the changes that caused the failure are not always easy to find we propose heuristic that ranks method changes that might have affected failed test indicating the likelihood that they may have contributed to test failure our heuristic is based on the calling structure of the failed test eg the number of ancestors and descendents of method in the test's call graph whether the caller or callee was changed etc we evaluated the effectiveness of the heuristic in pairs of edited versions in the eclipse jdt core plug in using the test suite from its compiler tests plug in our results indicate that when failure is caused by single method change our heuristic ranked the failure inducing change as number or number of all the method changes in of the delegate tests ie representatives of all failing tests even when the failure is caused by some combination of the changes rather than single change our heuristic still helps

voltage islanding technique in network on chip noc can significantly reduce the computational energy consumption by scaling down the voltage levels of the processing elements pes this reduction in energy consumption comes at the cost of the energy consumption of the level shifters between voltage islands moreover from physical design perspective it is desirable to have limited number of voltage islands considering voltage islanding during mapping of the pes to the noc routers can significantly reduce both the computational and the level shifter energy consumptions and the communication energy consumption on the noc links in this paper we formulate the problem as an optimization problem with an objective of minimizing the overall energy consumption constrained by the performance in terms of delay and the maximum number of voltage islands we provide the optimal solution to our problem using mixed integer linear program milp formulation we also propose heuristic based on random greedy selection to solve the problem experimental results using es benchmark applications and some real applications show that the heuristic finds near optimal solution in almost all cases in very small fraction of the time required to achieve the optimal solution
we extend controlled query evaluation cqe an inference control method to enforce confidentiality in static information systems under queries to updatable databases within the framework of the lying approach to cqe we study user update requests that have to be translated into new database state in order to avoid dangerous inferences some such updates have to be denied even though the new database instance would be compatible with set of integrity constraints in contrast some other updates leading to an incompatible instance should not be denied we design control method to resolve this seemingly paradoxical situation and then prove that the general security definitions of cqe and other properties linked to user updates hold

static program checking tools can find many serious bugs in software but due to analysis limitations they also frequently emit false error reports such false positives can easily render the error checker useless by hiding real errors amidst the false effective error report ranking schemes mitigate the problem of false positives by suppressing them during the report inspection process in this way ranking techniques provide complementary method to increasing the precision of the analysis results of checking tool weakness of previous ranking schemes however is that they produce static rankings that do not adapt as reports are inspected ignoring useful correlations amongst reports this paper addresses this weakness with two main contributions first we observe that both bugs and false positives frequently cluster by code locality we analyze clustering behavior in historical bug data from two large systems and show how clustering can be exploited to greatly improve error report ranking second we present general probabilistic technique for error ranking that exploits correlation behavior amongst reports and incorporates user feedback into the ranking process in our results we observe factor of improvement over randomized ranking for error reports emitted by both intra procedural and inter procedural analysis tools

standard pattern discovery techniques such as association rules suffer an extreme risk of finding very large numbers of spurious patterns for many knowledge discovery tasks the direct adjustment approach to controlling this risk applies statistical test during the discovery process using critical value adjusted to take account of the size of the search space however problem with the direct adjustment strategy is that it may discard numerous true patterns this paper investigates the assignment of different critical values to different areas of the search space as an approach to alleviating this problem using variant of technique originally developed for other purposes this approach is shown to be effective at increasing the number of discoveries while still maintaining strict control over the risk of false discoveries
multi stage programming msp provides disciplined approach to run time code generation in the purely functional setting it has been shown how msp can be used to reduce the overhead of abstractions allowing clean maintainable code without paying performance penalties unfortunately msp is difficult to combine with imperative features which are prevalent in mainstream languages the central difficulty is scope extrusion wherein free variables can inadvertently be moved outside the scopes of their binders this paper proposes new approach to combining msp with imperative features that occupies sweet spot in the design space in terms of how well useful msp applications can be expressed and how easy it is for programmers to understand the key insight is that escapes or anti quotes must be weakly separable from the rest of the code ie the computational effects occurring inside an escape that are visible outside the escape are guaranteed to not contain code to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach we formalize type system based on lightweight java which we prove sound and we also provide an implementation called mint to validate both the expressivity of the type system and the effect of staging on the performance of java programs
scheduling in large scale parallel systems has been and continues to be an important and challenging research problem several key factors including the increasing use of off the shelf clusters of workstations to build such parallel systems have resulted in the emergence of new class of scheduling strategies broadly referred to as dynamic coscheduling unfortunately the size of both the design and performance spaces of these emerging scheduling strategies is quite large due in part to the numerous dynamic interactions among the different components of the parallel computing environment as well as the wide range of applications and systems that can comprise the parallel environment this in turn makes it difficult to fully explore the benefits and limitations of the various proposed dynamic coscheduling approaches for large scale systems solely with the use of simulation and or experimentationto gain better understanding of the fundamental properties of different dynamic coscheduling methods we formulate general mathematical model of this class of scheduling strategies within unified framework that allows us to investigate wide range of parallel environments we derive matrix analytic analysis based on stochastic decomposition and fixed point iteration large number of numerical experiments are performed in part to examine the accuracy of our approach these numerical results are in excellent agreement with detailed simulation results our mathematical model and analysis is then used to explore several fundamental design and performance tradeoffs associated with the class of dynamic coscheduling policies across broad spectrum of parallel computing environments
in this paper we propose new index structure for object oriented databases the main idea of this is graph structure called signature graph which is constructed over signature file generated for class and improves the search of signature file dramatically in addition the signature files accordingly the signature graphs can be organized into hierarchy according to the nested structure called the aggregation hierarchy of classes in an object oriented database which leads to another significant improvements
schema mapping is specification that describes how data structured under one schema the source schema is to be transformed into data structured under different schema the target schema although the notion of an inverse of schema mapping is important the exact definition of an inverse mapping is somewhat elusive this is because schema mapping may associate many target instances with each source instance and many source instances with each target instance based on the notion that the composition of mapping and its inverse is the identity we give formal definition for what it means for schema mapping to be an inverse of schema mapping for class of source instances we call such an inverse an inverse particular case of interest arises when is the class of all instances in which case an inverse is global inverse we focus on the important and practical case of schema mappings defined by source to target tuple generating dependencies and uncover rich theory when is defined by set of dependencies with finite chase we show how to construct an inverse when one exists in particular we show how to construct global inverse when one exists given and we show how to define the largest class such that is an inverse of
we propose group membership service for dynamic ad hoc networks it maintains as long as possible the existing groups and ensures that each group diameter is always smaller than constant fixed according to the application using the groups the proposed protocol is self stabilizing and works in dynamic distributed systems moreover it ensures kind of continuity in the service offer to the application while the system is converging except if too strong topology changes happen such best effort behavior allows applications to rely on the groups while the stabilization has not been reached which is very useful in dynamic ad hoc networks
new approach for supporting reactive capability is described in the context of an advanced object oriented database system called adome ii besides having rich set of pre defined composite event expressions and well defined execution model adome ii supports an extensible approach to reactive processing so as to be able to gracefully accommodate dynamic applications requirements in this approach production rules combined with methods are used as unifying mechanism to process rules to enable incremental detection of composite events and to allow new composite event expressions to be introduced into the system declaratively this allows the definition of new production rules each time an extension of the model takes place methods of supporting new composite event expressions are described and comparisons with other relevant approaches are also conducted prototype of adome ii has been constructed which has as its implementation base an ordinary passive oodbms and production rule base system
human societies have long used the capability of argumentation and dialogue to overcome and resolve conflicts that may arise within their communities today there is an increasing level of interest in the application of such dialogue games within artificial agent societies in particular within the field of multi agent systems this theory of argumentation and dialogue games has become instrumental in designing rich interaction protocols and in providing agents with means to manage and resolve conflicts however to date much of the existing literature focuses on formulating theoretically sound and complete models for multi agent systems nonetheless in so doing it has tended to overlook the computational implications of applying such models in agent societies especially ones with complex social structures furthermore the systemic impact of using argumentation in multi agent societies and its interplay with other forms of social influences such as those that emanate from the roles and relationships of society within such contexts has also received comparatively little attention to this end this paper presents significant step towards bridging these gaps for one of the most important dialogue game types namely argumentation based negotiation abn the contributions are three fold first we present both theoretically grounded and computationally tractable abn framework that allows agents to argue negotiate and resolve conflicts relating to their social influences within multi agent society in particular the model encapsulates four fundamental elements scheme that captures the stereotypical pattern of reasoning about rights and obligations in an agent society ii mechanism to use this scheme to systematically identify social arguments to use in such contexts iii language and protocol to govern the agent interactions and iv set of decision functions to enable agents to participate in such dialogues second we use this framework to devise series of concrete algorithms that give agents set of abn strategies to argue and resolve conflicts in multi agent task allocation scenario in so doing we exemplify the versatility of our framework and its ability to facilitate complex argumentation dialogues within artificial agent societies finally we carry out series of experiments to identify how and when argumentation can be useful for agent societies in particular our results show clear inverse correlation between the benefit of arguing and the resources available within the context that when agents operate with imperfect knowledge an arguing approach allows them to perform more effectively than non arguing one that arguing earlier in an abn interaction presents more efficient method than arguing later in the interaction and that allowing agents to negotiate their social influences presents both an effective and an efficient method that enhances their performance within society
sampling conditions for recovering the homology of set using topological persistence are much weaker than sampling conditions required by any known polynomial time algorithm for producing topologically correct reconstruction under the former sampling conditions which we call weak sampling conditions we give an algorithm that outputs topologically correct reconstruction unfortunately even though the algorithm terminates its time complexity is unbounded motivated by the question of knowing if polynomial time algorithm for reconstruction exists under the weak sampling conditions we identify at the heart of our algorithm test which requires answering the following question given two dimensional simplicial complexes does there exist simplicial complex containing and contained in which realizes the persistent homology of into we call this problem the homological simplification of the pair and prove that this problem is np complete using reduction from sat

memory latency is an important bottleneck in system performance that cannot be adequately solved by hardware alone several promising software techniques have been shown to address this problem successfully in specific situations however the generality of these software approaches has been limited because current architecturtes do not provide fine grained low overhead mechanism for observing and reacting to memory behavior directly to fill this need this article proposes new class of memory operations called informing memory operations which essentially consist of memory operatin combined either implicitly or explicitly with conditional branch and ink operation that is taken only if the reference suffers cache miss this article describes two different implementations of informing memory operations one is based on cache outcome condition code and the other is based on low overhead traps we find that modern in order issue and out of order issue superscalar processors already contain the bulk of the necessary hardware support we describe how number of software based memory optimizations can exploit informing memory operations to enhance performance and we look at cache coherence with fine grained access control as case study our performance results demonstrate that the runtime overhead of invoking the informing mechanism on the alpha and mips processors is generally small enough to provide considerable flexibility to hardware and software designers and that the cache coherence application has improved performance compared to other current solutions we believe that the inclusion of informing memory operations in future processors may spur even more innovative performance optimizations

data on the web in html tables is mostly structured but we usually do not know the structure in advance thus we cannot directly query for data of interest we propose solution to this problem based on document independent extraction ontologies our solution entails elements of table understanding data integration and wrapper creation table understanding allows us to find tables of interest within web page recognize attributes and values within the table pair attributes with values and form records data integration techniques allow us to match source records with target schema ontologically specified wrappers allow us to extract data from source records into target schema experimental results show that we can successfully locate data of interest in tables and map the data from source html tables with unknown structure to given target database schema we can thus directly query source data with unknown structure through known target schema
recent proposals for chip multiprocessors cmps advocate speculative or implicit threading in which the hardware employs prediction to peel off instruction sequences ie implicit threads from the sequential execution stream and speculatively executes them in parallel on multiple processor cores these proposals augment conventional multiprocessor which employs explicit threading with the ability to handle implicit threads current proposals focus on only implicitly threaded code sections this paper identifies for the first time the issues in combining explicit and implicit threading we present the multiplex architecture to combine the two threading models multiplex exploits the similarities between implicit and explicit threading and provides unified support for the two threading models without additional hardware multiplex groups subset of protocol states in an implicitly threaded cmp to provide write invalidate protocol for explicit threads using fully integrated compiler infrastructure for automatic generation of multiplex code this paper presents detailed performance analysis for entire benchmarks instead of just implicitly threaded sections as done in previous papers we show that neither threading models alone performs consistently better than the other across the benchmarks cmp with four dual issue cpus achieves speedup of and over one dual issue cpu using implicit only and explicit only threading respectively multiplex matches or outperforms the better of the two threading models for every benchmark and four cpu multiplex achieves speedup of our detailed analysis indicates that the dominant overheads in an implicitly threaded cmp are speculation state overflow due to limited cache capacity and load imbalance and data dependences in fine grain threads
task scheduling is an essential aspect of parallel programming most heuristics for this np hard problem are based on simple system model that assumes fully connected processors and concurrent interprocessor communication hence contention for communication resources is not considered in task scheduling yet it has strong influence on the execution time of parallel program this paper investigates the incorporation of contention awareness into task scheduling new system model for task scheduling is proposed allowing us to capture both end point and network contention to achieve this the communication network is reflected by topology graph for the representation of arbitrary static and dynamic networks the contention awareness is accomplished by scheduling the communications represented by the edges in the task graph onto the links of the topology graph edge scheduling is theoretically analyzed including aspects like heterogeneity routing and causality the proposed contention aware scheduling preserves the theoretical basis of task scheduling it is shown how classic list scheduling is easily extended to this more accurate system model experimental results show the significantly improved accuracy and efficiency of the produced schedules
we revisit the shortest path problem in asynchronous duty cycled wireless sensor networks which exhibit time dependent features we model the time varying link cost and distance from each node to the sink as periodic functions we show that the time cost function satisfies the fifo property which makes the time dependent shortest path problem solvable in polynomial time using the synchronizer we propose fast distributed algorithm to build all to one shortest paths with polynomial message complexity and time complexity the algorithm determines the shortest paths for all discrete times with single execution in contrast with multiple executions needed by previous solutions we further propose an efficient distributed algorithm for time dependent shortest path maintenance the proposed algorithm is loop free with low message complexity and low space complexity of maxdeg where maxdeg is the maximum degree for all nodes the performance of our solution is evaluated under diverse network configurations the results suggest that our algorithm is more efficient than previous solutions in terms of message complexity and space complexity
the semantic web not only contains resources but also includes the heterogeneous relationships among them which is sharply distinguished from the current web as the growth of the semantic web specialized search techniques are of significance in this paper we present rss framework for enabling ranked semantic search on the semantic web in this framework the heterogeneity of relationships is fully exploited to determine the global importance of resources in addition the search results can be greatly expanded with entities most semantically related to the query thus able to provide users with properly ordered semantic search results by combining global ranking values and the relevance between the resources and the query the proposed semantic search model which supports inference is very different from traditional keyword based search methods moreover rss also distinguishes from many current methods of accessing the semantic web data in that it applies novel ranking strategies to prevent returning search results in disorder the experimental results show that the framework is feasible and can produce better ordering of semantic search results than directly applying the standard pagerank algorithm on the semantic web

energy usage has been an important concern in recent research on online scheduling in this paper we extend the study of the tradeoff between flow time and energy from the single processor setting to the multi processor setting our main result is an analysis of simple non migratory online algorithm called crr classified round robin on processors showing that its flow time plus energy is within times of the optimal non migratory offline algorithm when the maximum allowable speed is slightly relaxed this result still holds even if the comparison is made against the optimal migratory offline algorithm the competitive ratio increases by factor of as special case our work also contributes to the traditional online flow time scheduling specifically for minimizing flow time only crr can yield competitive ratio one or even arbitrarily smaller than one when using sufficiently faster processors prior to our work similar result is only known for online algorithms that needs migration while the best non migratory result can achieve an competitive ratio the above result stems from an interesting observation that there always exists some optimal migratory schedule that can be converted in an offline sense to non migratory schedule with moderate increase in flow time plus energy more importantly this non migratory schedule always dispatches jobs in the same way as crr

we present probabilistic model of user affect designed to allow an intelligent agent to recognise multiple user emotions during the interaction with an educational computer game our model is based on probabilistic framework that deals with the high level of uncertainty involved in recognizing variety of user emotions by combining in dynamic bayesian network information on both the causes and effects of emotional reactions the part of the framework that reasons from causes to emotions diagnostic model implements theoretical model of affect the occ model which accounts for how emotions are caused by one's appraisal of the current context in terms of one's goals and preferences the advantage of using the occ model is that it provides an affective agent with explicit information not only on which emotions user feels but also why thus increasing the agent's capability to effectively respond to the users emotions the challenge is that building the model requires having mechanisms to assess user goals and how the environment fits them form of plan recognition in this paper we illustrate how we built the predictive part of the affective model by combining general theories with empirical studies to adapt the theories to our target application domain we then present results on the model's accuracy showing that the model achieves good accuracy on several of the target emotions we also discuss the model's limitations to open the ground for the next stage of the work ie complementing the model with diagnostic information
this paper evaluates the combination of two methods for adapting bipedal locomotion to explore virtual environments displayed on head mounted displays hmds within the confines of limited tracking spaces we combine method of changing the optic flow of locomotion effectively scaling the translational gain with method of intervening and manipulating user's locations in physical space while preserving their spatial awareness of the virtual space this latter technique is called resetting in two experiments we evaluate both scaling the translational gain and resetting while subject locomotes along path and then turns to face remembered object we find that the two techniques can be effectively combined although there is cognitive cost to resetting

dynamic optimizers modify the binary code of programs at runtime by profiling and optimizing certain aspects of the execution we present completely software based framework that dynamically optimizes programs for object based distributed shared memory dsm systems in dsm systems reducing the number of messages between nodes is crucial prefetching transfers data in advance from the storage node to the local node so that communication is minimized our framework uses profiler and dynamic binary rewriter that monitors the access behavior of the application and places prefetches where they are beneficial to speed up the application in addition we adapt the number of prefetches per request to best fit the application's behavior evaluation shows that the performance of our system is better than manual prefetching the number of messages sent decreases by up to performance gains of up to can be observed on the benchmarks
we present novel approach to parameterize mesh with disk topology to the plane in shape preserving manner our key contribution is local global algorithm which combines local mapping of each triangle to the plane using transformations taken from restricted set with global stitch operation of all triangles involving sparse linear system the local transformations can be taken from variety of families eg similarities or rotations generating different types of parameterizations in the first case the parameterization tries to force each triangle to be an as similar as possible version of its counterpart this is shown to yield results identical to those of the lscm algorithm in the second case the parameterization tries to force each triangle to be an as rigid as possible version of its counterpart this approach preserves shape as much as possible it is simple effective and fast due to pre factoring of the linear system involved in the global phase experimental results show that our approach provides almost isometric parameterizations and obtains more shape preserving results than other state of the art approaches we present also more general hybrid parameterization model which provides continuous spectrum of possibilities controlled by single parameter the two cases described above lie at the two ends of the spectrum we generalize our local global algorithm to compute these parameterizations the local phase may also be accelerated by parallelizing the independent computations per triangle
inserting virtual objects in real camera images with correct lighting is an active area of research current methods use high dynamic range camera with fish eye lens to capture the incoming illumination the main problem with this approach is the limitation to distant illumination therefore the focus of our work is real time description of both near and far field illumination for interactive movement of virtual objects in the camera image of real room the daylight which is coming in through the windows produces spatially varying distribution of indirect light in the room therefore near field description of incoming light is necessary our approach is to measure the daylight from outside and to simulate the resulting indirect light in the room to accomplish this we develop special dynamic form of the irradiance volume for real time updates of indirect light in the room and combine this with importance sampling and shadow maps for light from outside this separation allows object movements with interactive frame rates fps to verify the correctness of our approach we compare images of synthetic objects with real objects

novel space time representation str of iterative algorithms for their systematic mapping onto regular processor arrays is proposed timing information is introduced in the dependence graph dg by the definition and the construction of the space time dg stdg any variable instance of the loop body independently of the number of the loop indices is characterized by an integer vector composed by its indices as space part and an additional time index representing its execution time according to preliminary timing the main advantage of the str is that the need for the uniformization of the algorithm is avoided moreover it is proven that in the stdg dependence vectors having opposite directions do not exist and therefore linear mapping of the stdg onto the desired processor array can always be derived efficient and regular architectures are produced by applying the str to the original description of the warshall floyd algorithm for the algebraic path problem
we propose an algorithm to improve the quality of depth maps used for multi view stereo mvs many existing mvs techniques make use of two stage approach which estimates depth maps from neighbouring images and then merges them to extract final surface often the depth maps used for the merging stage will contain outliers due to errors in the matching process traditional systems exploit redundancy in the image sequence the surface is seen in many views in order to make the final surface estimate robust to these outliers in the case of sparse data sets there is often insufficient redundancy and thus performance degrades as the number of images decreases in order to improve performance in these circumstances it is necessary to remove the outliers from the depth maps we identify the two main sources of outliers in top performing algorithm spurious matches due to repeated texture and matching failure due to occlusion distortion and lack of texture we propose two contributions to tackle these failure modes firstly we store multiple depth hypotheses and use spatial consistency constraint to extract the true depth secondly we allow the algorithm to return an unknown state when the true depth estimate cannot be found by combining these in discrete label mrf optimisation we are able to obtain high accuracy depth maps with low numbers of outliers we evaluate our algorithm in multi view stereo framework and find it to confer state of the art performance with the leading techniques in particular on the standard evaluation sparse data sets

the rapid increase in ic design complexity and wide spread use of intellectual property ip blocks have made the so called mixed size placement very important topic in recent years although several algorithms have been proposed for mixed sized placements most of them primarily focus on the global placement aspect in this paper we propose three step approach named xdp for mixed size detailed placement first combination of constraint graph and linear programming is used to legalize macros then an enhanced greedy method is used to legalize the standard cells finally sliding window based cell swapping is applied to further reduce wirelength the impact of individual techniques is analyzed and quantified experiments show that when applied to the set of global placement results generated by aplace xdp can produce wirelength comparable to the native detailed placement of aplace and shorter wirelength compared to fengshui when applied to the set of global placements generated by mpl xdp is the only detailed placement that successfully produces legal placement for all the examples while aplace and fengshui fail for and of the examples for cases where legal placements can be compared the wirelength produced by xdp is shorter by on average compared to aplace and fengshui furthermore xdp displays higher robustness than the other tools by covering broader spectrum of examples by different global placement tools
efficient access to web content remains elusive for individuals accessing the web using assistive technology previous efforts to improve web accessibility have focused on developer awareness technological improvement and legislation but these approaches have left remaining concerns first while many tools can help produce accessible content these tools are generally difficult to integrate into existing developer workflows and rarely offer specific suggestions that developers can implement second tools that automatically improve web content for users generally solve specific problems and are difficult to combine and use on diversity of existing assistive technology finally although blind web users have proven adept at overcoming the shortcomings of the web and existing tools they have been only marginally involved in improving the accessibility of their own web experience as first step toward addressing these concerns we introduce accessmonkey common scripting framework that web users web developers and web researchers can use to collaboratively improve accessibility this framework advances the idea that javascript and dynamic web content can be used to improve inaccessible content instead of being cause of it using accessmonkey web users and developers on different platforms with potentially different goals can collaboratively make the web more accessible in this paper we first present the accessmonkey framework describe three implementations of it that we have created and offer several example scripts that demonstrate its utility we conclude by discussing future extensions of this work that will provide efficient access to scripts as users browse the web and allow non technical users be involved in creating scripts

while significant amount of research efforts has been reported on developing algorithms based on joins and semijoins to tackle distributed query processing there is relatively little progress made toward exploring the complexity of the problems studied as result proving np hardness of or devising polynomial time algorithms for certain distributed query optimization problems has been elaborated upon by many researchers however due to its inherent difficulty the complexity of the majority of problems on distributed query optimization remains unknown in this paper we generally characterize the distributed query optimization problems and provide frame work to explore their complexity as it will be shown most distributed query optimization problems can be transformed into an optimization problem comprising set of binary decisions termed sum product optimization spo problem we first prove spo is np hard in light of the np completeness of well known problem knapsack knap then using this result as basis we prove that five classes of distributed query optimization problems which cover the majority of distributed query optimization problems previously studied in the literature are np hard by polynomially reducing spo to each of them the detail for each problem transformation is derived we not only prove the conjecture that many prior studies relied upon but also provide frame work for future related studies
it is often argued that usability problems should be identified as early as possible during software development but many usability evaluation methods do not fit well in early development activities we propose method for usability evaluation of use cases widely used representation of design ideas produced early in software development processes the method proceeds by systematic inspection of use cases with reference to set of guidelines for usable design to validate the method four evaluators inspected set of use cases for health care application the usability problems predicted by the evaluators were compared to the result of conventional think aloud test about one fourth of the problems were identified by both think aloud testing and use case inspection about half of the predicted problems not found by think aloud testing were assessed as providing useful input to early development qualitative data on the evaluators experience using the method are also presented on this background we argue that use case inspection has promising potential and discuss its limitations

intrusion prevention system ips has been an effective tool to detect and prevent unwanted attempts which are mainly through network and system vulnerabilities at accessing and manipulating computer systems intrusion detection and prevention are two main functions of ips as attacks are becoming massive and complex the traditional centralized ipses are incapable of detecting all those attempts the existing distributed ipses mainly based on mobile agent have some serious problems such as weak security of mobile agents response latency large code size in this paper we propose customized intrusion prevention system vmfence in distributed virtual computing environment to simplify the complexity of the management in vmfence the states of detection processes vary with those of virtual machines vms which are described by deterministic finite automata dfa the detection processes each of which detects one virtual machine reside in privileged virtual machine the processes run synchronously and outside of vms in order to achieve high performance and security the experimental results also show vmfence has higher detection efficiency than traditional intrusion detection systems and little impact on the performance of the monitored vms
the rewrite based approach provides executable specifications for security policies which can be independently designed verified and then anchored on programs using modular discipline in this paper we describe how to perform queries over these rule based policies in order to increase the trust of the policy author on the correct behavior of the policy the analysis we provide is founded on the strategic narrowing process which provides both the necessary abstraction for simulating executions of the policy over access requests and the mechanism for solving what if queries from the security administrator we illustrate this general approach by the analysis of firewall system policy
power is an important design constraint in embedded computing systems to meet the power constraint microarchitecture and hardware designed to achieve high performance need to be revisited from both performance and power angles this paper studies one of them branch predictor as well known branch prediction is critical to exploit instruction level parallelism effectively but may incur additional power consumption due to the hardware resource dedicated for branch prediction and the extra power consumed on mispredicted branches this paper explores the design space of branch prediction mechanisms and tries to find the most beneficial one to realize iow power embedded processor the sample processor studied is godson like processor which is dual issue out of order processor with deep pipeline supporting mips instruction set

many activities in business process management such as process retrieval process mining and process integration need to determine the similarity or the distance between two processes although several approaches have recently been proposed to measure the similarity between business processes neither the definitions of the similarity notion between processes nor the measure methods have gained wide recognition in this paper we define the similarity and the distance based on firing sequences in the context of workflow nets wf nets as the unified reference concepts however to many wf nets either the number of full firing sequences or the length of single firing sequence is infinite since transition adjacency relations tars can be seen as the genes of the firing sequences which describe transition orders appearing in all possible firing sequences we propose practical similarity definition based on the tar sets of two processes it is formally shown that the corresponding distance measure between processes is metric an algorithm using model reduction techniques for the efficient computation of the measure is also presented experimental results involving comparison of different measures on artificial processes and evaluations on clustering real life processes validate our approach
frequent pattern mining has been studied extensively and has many useful applications however frequent pattern mining often generates too many patterns to be truly efficient or effective in many applications it is sufficient to generate and examine frequent patterns with sufficiently good approximation of the support frequency instead of in full precision such compact but close enough frequent pattern base is called condensed frequent pattern basein this paper we propose and examine several alternatives for the design representation and implementation of such condensed frequent pattern bases several algorithms for computing such pattern bases are proposed their effectiveness at pattern compression and methods for efficiently computing them are investigated systematic performance study is conducted on different kinds of databases and demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in handling frequent pattern mining in large databases
ultra low voltage operation has recently drawn significant attention due to its large potential energy savings however typical design practices used for super threshold operation are not necessarily compatible with the low voltage regime here radically different guidelines may be needed since existing process technologies have been optimized for super threshold operation we therefore study the selection of the optimal technology in ultra low voltage designs to achieve minimum energy and minimum variability which are among foremost concerns we investigate five industrial technologies from nm to nm we demonstrate that mature technologies are often the best choice in very low voltage applications saving as much as in total energy consumption compared to poorly selected technology in parallel the effect of technology choice on variability is investigated when operating at the energy optimal design point the results show up to improvement in delay variation due to global process shift and mismatch when using the most advanced technologies despite their large variability at nominal vdd
self adjusting computation offers language centric approach to writing programs that can automatically respond to modifications to their data eg inputs except for several domain specific implementations however all previous implementations of self adjusting computation assume mostly functional higher order languages such as standard ml prior to this work it was not known if self adjusting computation can be made to work with low level imperative languages such as without placing undue burden on the programmer we describe the design and implementation of ceal based language for self adjusting computation the language is fully general and extends with small number of primitives to enable writing self adjusting programs in style similar to conventional programs we present efficient compilation techniques for translating ceal programs into that can be compiled with existing compilers using primitives supplied by run time library for self adjusting computation we implement the proposed compiler and evaluate its effectiveness our experiments show that ceal is effective in practice compiled self adjusting programs respond to small modifications to their data by orders of magnitude faster than recomputing from scratch while slowing down from scratch run by moderate constant factor compared to previous work we measure significant space and time improvements
in recent years privacy model called anonymity has gained popularity in the microdata releasing as the microdata may contain multiple sensitive attributes about an individual the protection of multiple sensitive attributes has become an important problem different from the existing models of single sensitive attribute extra associations among multiple sensitive attributes should be invested two kinds of disclosure scenarios may happen because of logical associations the diversity is checked to prevent the foregoing disclosure risks with an requirement definition used to ensure the diversity requirement at last two step greedy generalization algorithm is used to carry out the multiple sensitive attributes processing which deal with quasi identifiers and sensitive attributes respectively we reduce the overall distortion by the measure of masking sa

many web information services utilize techniques of information extraction ie to collect important facts from the web to create more advanced services one possible method is to discover thematic information from the collected facts through text classification however most conventional text classification techniques rely on manual labelled corpora and are thus ill suited to cooperate with web information services with open domains in this work we present system named liveclassifier that can automatically train classifiersthrough web corpora based on user defined topic hierarchies due to its flexibility and convenience liveclassifier can be easily adapted for various purposes new web information services can be created to fully exploit it human users can use it to create classifiers for their personal applications the effectiveness of classifiers created by liveclassifier is well supportedby empirical evidence
the amount and variety of data available electronically have dramatically increased in the last decade however data and documents are stored in different ways and do not usually show their internal structure in order to take full advantage of the topological structure of digital documents and particularly web sites their hierarchical organization should be exploited by introducing notion of query similar to the one used in database systems good approach in that respect is the one provided by graphical query languages originally designed to model object bases and later proposed for semistructured data like log the aim of this paper is to provide suitable graph based semantics to this language supporting both data structure variability and topological similarities between queries and document structures suite of operational semantics based on the notion of bisimulation is introduced both at the concrete level instances and at the abstract level schemata giving rise to semantic framework that benefits from the cross fertilization of tools originally designed in quite different research areas databases concurrency logics static analysis
multiprocessor interconnection networks may reach congestion with high traffic loads which prevents reaching the wished performance unfortunately many of the mechanisms proposed in the literature for congestion control either suffer from lack of robustness being unable to work properly with different traffic patterns or message lengths or detect congestion relying on global information that wastes some network bandwidth this paper presents family of mechanisms to avoid network congestion in wormhole networks all of them need only local information applying message throttling when it is required the proposed mechanisms use different strategies to detect network congestion and also apply different corrective actions the mechanisms are evaluated and compared for several network loads and topologies noticeably improving network performance with high loads but without penalizing network behavior for low and medium traffic rates where no congestion control is required
beyond certain number of cores multi core processing chips will require network on chip noc to interconnect the cores and overcome the limitations of bus nocs must be carefully designed to meet constraints like power consumption area and ultra low latencies although meshes with dor dimension order routing meet these constraints the need for partitioning eg virtual machines coherency domains and traffic isolation may prevent the use of dor routing also core heterogeneity and manufacturing and run time faults may lead to partially irregular topologies routing in these topologies is complex and previously proposed solutions required routing tables which drastically increase power consumption area and latency the exception is lbdr logic based distributed routing flexible routing method for irregular topologies that removes the need for using routing tables both at end nodes and switches thus achieving large savings in chip area and power consumption but lbdr lacks support for multicast and broadcast which are required to efficiently support cache coherence protocols both for single and multiple coherence domains
geography is becoming increasingly important in web search search engines can often return better results to users by analyzing features such as user location or geographic terms in web pages and user queries this is also of great commercial value as it enables location specific advertising and improved search for local businesses as result major search companies have invested significant resources into geographic search technologies also often called local search this paper studies geographic search queries ie text queries such as hotel new york that employ geographical terms in an attempt to restrict results to particular region or location our main motivation is to identify opportunities for improving geographical search and related technologies and we perform an analysis of million queries of the recently released aol query trace first we identify typical properties of geographic search geo queries based on manual examination of several thousand queries based on these observations we build classifier that separates the trace into geo and non geo queries we then investigate the properties of geo queries in more detail and relate them to web sites and users associated with such queries we also propose new taxonomy for geographic search queries

when we attempted to introduce an extractive approach to company we were faced with challenging project situation where legacy applications did not have many commonalities among their implementations as they were developed independently by different teams without sharing common code base although there were not many structural similarities we expected to find similarities if we view them from the domain model perspective as they were in the same domain and were developed with the object oriented paradigm therefore we decided to place the domain model at the center of extraction and reengineering thus developing domain model based extractive method the method has been successfully applied to introduce software product line to set top box manufacturing company
previous research on mining sequential patterns mainly focused on discovering patterns from point based event data little effort has been put toward mining patterns from interval based event data where pair of time values is associated with each event kam and fu's work in identified temporal relationships between two intervals according to these temporal relationships new variant of temporal patterns was defined for interval based event data unfortunately the patterns defined in this manner are ambiguous which means that the temporal relationships among events cannot be correctly represented in temporal patterns to resolve this problem we first define new kind of nonambiguous temporal pattern for interval based event data then the tprefixspan algorithm is developed to mine the new temporal patterns from interval based events the completeness and accuracy of the results are also proven the experimental results show that the efficiency and scalability of the tprefixspan algorithm are satisfactory furthermore to show the applicability and effectiveness of temporal pattern mining we execute experiments to discover temporal patterns from historical nasdaq data

existing methods place data or code in scratchpad memory ie spm by either relying on heuristics or resorting to integer programming or mapping it to graph coloring problem in this work the spm allocation problem is formulated as an interval coloring problem the key observation is that in many embedded applications arrays including structs as special case are often related in the following way for any two arrays their live ranges are often such that one is either disjoint from or contains the other as result array interference graphs are often superperfect graphs and optimal interval colorings for such array interference graphs are possible this has led to the development of two new spm allocation algorithms while differing in whether live range splits and spills are done sequentially or together both algorithms place arrays in spm based on examining the cliques in an interference graph in both cases we guarantee optimally that all arrays in an interference graph can be placed in spm if its size is no smaller than the clique number of the graph in the case that the spm is not large enough we rely on heuristics to split or spill live range until the graph is colorable our experiment results using embedded benchmarks show that our algorithms can outperform graph coloring when their interference graphs are superperfect or nearly so although graph coloring is admittedly more general and may also be effective to applications with arbitrary interference graphs

the wide adoption of xml has increased the interest of the database community on tree structured data management techniques querying capabilities are provided through tree pattern queries the need for querying tree structured data sources when their structure is not fully known and the need to integrate multiple data sources with different tree structures have driven recently the suggestion of query languages that relax the complete specification of tree pattern in this paper we use query language which allows partial tree pattern queries ptpqs the structure in ptpq can be flexibly specified fully partially or not at all to evaluate ptpq we exploit index graphs which generate an equivalent set of complete tree pattern queriesin order to process ptpqs we need to efficiently solve the ptpq satisfiability and containment problems these problems become more complex in the context of ptpqs because the partial specification of the structure allows new non trivial structural expressions to be derived from those explicitly specified in ptpq we address the problem of ptpq satisfiability and containment in the absence and in the presence of index graphs and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for each case to cope with the high complexity of ptpq containment in the presence of index graphs we study family of heuristic approaches for ptpq containment based on structural information extracted from the index graph in advance and on the fly we implement our approaches and we report on their extensive experimental evaluation and comparison

programs written in managed languages are compiled to platform independent intermediate representation such as java bytecode the relative high level of java bytecode has engendered widespread practice of changing the bytecode directly without modifying the maintained version of the source code this practice called bytecode engineering or enhancement has become indispensable in introducing various concerns including persistence distribution and security transparently for example transparent persistence architectures help avoid the entanglement of business and persistence logic in the source code by changing the bytecode directly to synchronize objects with stable storage with functionality added directly at the bytecode level the source code reflects only partial semantics of the program specifically the programmer can neither ascertain the program's runtime behavior by browsing its source code nor map the runtime behavior back to the original source code this paper presents an approach that improves the utility of source level programming tools by providing enhancement specifications written in domain specific language by interpreting the specifications source level programming tool can gain an awareness of the bytecode enhancements and improve its precision and usability we demonstrate the applicability of our approach by making source code editor and symbolic debugger enhancements aware
software changes during their life cycle software systems experience wide spectrum of changes from minor modifications to major architectural shifts small scale changes are usually performed with text editing and refactorings while large scale transformations require dedicated program transformation languages for medium scale transformations both approaches have disadvantages manual modifications may require myriad of similar yet not identical edits leading to errors and omissions while program transformation languages have steep learning curve and thus only pay off for large scale transformationswe present system supporting example based program transformation to define transformation programmer performs an example change manually feeds it into our system and generalizes it to other application contexts with time developer can build palette of reusable medium sized code transformations we provide detailed description of our approach and illustrate it with examples
future multicore processors will be more susceptible to variety of hardware failures in particular intermittent faults caused in part by manufacturing thermal and voltage variations can cause bursts of frequent faults that last from several cycles to several seconds or more due to practical limitations of circuit techniques cost effective reliability will likely require the ability to temporarily suspend execution on core during periods of intermittent faults we investigate three of the most obvious techniques for adapting to the dynamically changing resource availability caused by intermittent faults and demonstrate their different system level implications we show that system software reconfiguration has very high overhead that temporarily pausing execution on faulty core can lead to cascading livelock and that using spare cores has high fault free cost to remedy these and other drawbacks of the three baseline techniques we propose using thin hardware firmware layer to manage an overcommitted system one where the os is configured to use more virtual processors than the number of currently available physical cores we show that this proposed technique can gracefully degrade performance during intermittent faults of various duration with low overhead without involving system software and without requiring spare cores
refactorings are usually proposed in an ad hoc way because it is difficult to prove that they are sound with respect to formal semantics not guaranteeing the absence of type errors or semantic changes consequently developers using refactoring tools must rely on compilation and tests to ensure type correctness and semantics preservation respectively which may not be satisfactory to critical software development in this paper we formalize static semantics for alloy which is formal object oriented modeling language and encode it in prototype verification system pvs the static semantics formalization can be useful for specifying and proving that transformations in general not only refactorings do not introduce type errors for instance as we show here
entity matching is the problem of deciding if two given mentions in the data such as helen hunt and hunt refer to the same real world entity numerous solutions have been developed but they have not considered in depth the problem of exploiting integrity constraints that frequently exist in the domains examples of such constraints include mention with age two cannot match mention with salary and if two paper citations match then their authors are likely to match in the same order in this paper we describe probabilistic solution to entity matching that exploits such constraints to improve matching accuracy at the heart of the solution is generative model that takes into account the constraints during the generation process and provides well defined interpretations of the constraints we describe novel combination of em and relaxation labeling algorithms that efficiently learns the model thereby matching mentions in an unsupervised way without the need for annotated training data experiments on several real world domains show that our solution can exploit constraints to significantly improve matching accuracy by and that the solution scales up to large data sets
unifying terminology usages which captures more term semantics is useful for event clustering this paper proposes metric of normalized chain edit distance to mine incrementally controlled vocabulary from cross document coreference chains controlled vocabulary is employed to unify terms among different co reference chains novel threshold model that incorporates both time decay function and spanning window uses the controlled vocabulary for event clustering on streaming news under correct co reference chains the proposed system has performance increase compared to the baseline system and performance increase compared to the system without introducing controlled vocabulary furthermore chinese co reference resolution system with chain filtering mechanism is used to experiment on the robustness of the proposed event clustering system the clustering system using noisy co reference chains still achieves performance increase compared to the baseline system the above shows that our approach is promising
in this paper assuming that each node is incident with two or more fault free links we show that an dimensional alternating group graph can tolerate up to link faults where while retaining fault free hamiltonian cycle the proof is computer assisted the result is optimal with respect to the number of link faults tolerated previously without the assumption at most link faults can be tolerated for the same problem and the same graph
under the tuple level uncertainty paradigm we formalize the use of novel graphical model generator recognizer network grn as model of probabilistic databases the grn modeling framework is capable of representing much wider range of tuple dependency structure we show that grn representation of probabilistic database may undergo transitions induced by imposing constraints or evaluating queries we formalize procedures for these two types of transitions such that the resulting graphical models after transitions remain as grns this formalism makes grn self contained modeling framework and closed representation system for probabilistic databases property that is lacking in most existing models in addition we show that exploiting the transitional mechanisms allows systematic approach to constructing grns for arbitrary probabilistic data at arbitrary stages advantages of grns in query evaluation are also demonstrated
past research on probabilistic databases has studied the problem of answering queries on static database application scenarios of probabilistic databases however often involve the conditioning of database using additional information in the form of new evidence the conditioning problem is thus to transform probabilistic database of priors into posterior probabilistic database which is materialized for subsequent query processing or further refinement it turns out that the conditioning problem is closely related to the problem of computing exact tuple confidence values it is known that exact confidence computation is an np hard problem this has led researchers to consider approximation techniques for confidence computation however neither conditioning nor exact confidence computation can be solved using such techniques in this paper we present efficient techniques for both problems we study several problem decomposition methods and heuristics that are based on the most successful search techniques from constraint satisfaction such as the davis putnam algorithm we complement this with thorough experimental evaluation of the algorithms proposed our experiments show that our exact algorithms scale well to realistic database sizes and can in some scenarios compete with the most efficient previous approximation algorithms
server pages also called dynamic pages render generic web page into many similar ones the technique is commonly used for implementing web application user interfaces uis yet our previous study found high rate of repetitions also called lsquo clones rsquo in web applications particularly in uis the finding raised the question as to why such repetitions had not been averted with the use of server pages for an answer we conducted an experiment using php server pages to explore how far server pages can be pushed to achieve generic web applications our initial findings suggested that generic representation obtained using server pages sometimes compromises certain important system qualities such as run time performance it may also complicate the use of wysiwyg editors we have analysed the nature of these trade offs and now propose mixed strategy approach to obtain optimum generic representation of web applications without unnecessary compromise to critical system qualities and user experience the mixed strategy approach applies the generative technique of xvcl to achieve genericity at the meta level representation of web application leaving repetitions to the actual web application our experiments show that the mixed strategy approach can achieve good level of genericity without conflicting with other system qualities our findings should open the way for others to better informed decisions regarding generic design solutions which should in turn lead to simpler more maintainable and more reusable web applications copyright copy john wiley sons ltd
web data extraction systems in use today mainly focus on the generation of extraction rules ie wrapper induction thus they appear ad hoc and are difficult to integrate when holistic view is taken each phase in the data extraction process is disconnected and does not share common foundation to make the building of complete system straightforward in this paper we demonstrate holistic approach to web data extraction the principal component of our proposal is the notion of document schema document schemata are patterns of structures embedded in documents once the document schemata are obtained the various phases eg training set preparation wrapper induction and document classification can be easily integrated the implication of this is improved efficiency and better control over the extraction procedure our experimental results confirmed this more importantly because document can be represented as avector of schema it can be easily incorporated into existing systems as the fabric for integration

tiling is crucial loop transformation for generating high performance code on modern architectures efficient generation of multi level tiled code is essential for maximizing data reuse in systems with deep memory hierarchies tiled loops with parametric tile sizes not compile time constants facilitate runtime feedback and dynamic optimizations used in iterative compilation and automatic tuning previous parametric multi level tiling approaches have been restricted to perfectly nested loops where all assignment statements are contained inside the innermost loop of loop nest previous solutions to tiling for imperfect loop nests have only handled fixed tile sizes in this paper we present an approach to parametric multi level tiling of imperfectly nested loops the tiling technique generates loops that iterate over full rectangular tiles making them amenable to compiler optimizations such as register tiling experimental results using number of computational benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed tiling approach
popular web sites are expected to handle huge number of requests concurrently within reasonable time frame the performance of these web sites is largely dependent on effective thread management of their web servers although the implementation of static and dynamic thread policies is common practice remarkably little is known about the implications on performance moreover the commonly used policies do not take into account the complex interaction between the threads that compete for access to shared resource we propose new dynamic thread assignment policies that minimize the average response time of web servers the web server is modeled as two layered tandem of multi threading queues where the active threads compete for access to common resource this type of two layered queueing model which occurs naturally in the performance modeling of systems with intensive software hardware interaction are on the one hand appealing from an application point of view but on the other hand are challenging from methodological point of view our results show that the optimal dynamic thread assignment policies yield strong reductions in the response times validation on an apache web server shows that our dynamic thread policies confirm our analytical results
in constructive type theory recursive and corecursive definitions are subject to syntactic restrictions which guarantee termination for recursive functions and productivity for corecursive functions however many terminating and productive functions do not pass the syntactic tests bove proposed in her thesis an elegant reformulation of the method of accessibility predicates that widens the range of terminative recursive functions formalisable in constructive type theory in this paper we pursue the same goal for productive corecursive functions notably our method of formalisation of coinductive definitions of productive functions in coq requires not only the use of ad hoc predicates but also systematic algorithm that separates the inductive and coinductive parts of functions

approximate query answering has recently emerged as an effective method for generating viable answer among various techniques for approximate query answering wavelets have received lot of attention however wavelet techniques minimizing the root squared error ie the norm error have several problems such as the poor quality of reconstructed data when the original data is biased in this paper we present amid approximation of multi measured data using svd for multi measured data in amid we adapt the singular value decomposition svd to compress multi measured data we show that svd guarantees the root squared error and also drive an error bound of svd for an individual data value using mathematical analyses in addition in order to improve the accuracy of approximated data we combine svd and wavelets in amid since svd is applied to fixed matrix we use various properties of matrices to adapt svd to the incremental update environment we devise two variants of amid for the incremental update environment incremental amid and local amid to the best of our knowledge our work is the first to extend svd to incremental update environments
in this paper we propose two simple and efficient schemes for establishing anonymity in clustered wireless sensor networks cwsns the first scheme simple anonymity scheme sas uses range of pseudonyms as identifiers for node to ensure concealment of its true identifier id after deployment neighbouring nodes share their individual pseudonyms and use them for anonymous communication the second scheme cryptographic anonymity scheme cas uses keyed cryptographic one way hash function kchf for id concealment in cas neighbouring nodes securely share the information used by the kchf to generate pseudonyms even when many nodes in neighbourhood are compromised and are colluding our schemes guarantee complete anonymity to non compromised nodes during their mutual communication our schemes have reasonably low memory and computation costs they can be embedded into any wireless sensor network routing protocol to ensure anonymity and privacy during node discovery routing and data delivery

knowing patterns of relationship in social network is very useful for law enforcement agencies to investigate collaborations among criminals for businesses to exploit relationships to sell products or for individuals who wish to network with others after all it is not just what you know but also whom you know that matters however finding out who is related to whom on large scale is complex problem asking every single individual would be impractical given the huge number of individuals and the changing dynamics of relationships recent advancement in technology has allowed more data about activities of individuals to be collected such data may be mined to reveal associations between these individuals specifically we focus on data having space and time elements such as logs of people's movement over various locations or of their internet activities at various cyber locations reasoning that individuals who are frequently found together are likely to be associated with each other we mine from the data instances where several actors co occur in space and time presumably due to an underlying interaction we call these spatio temporal co occurrences events which we use to establish relationships between pairs of individuals in this paper we propose model for constructing social network from events and provide an algorithm that mines these events from the data experiments on real life data tracking people's accesses to cyber locations have also yielded encouraging results
understanding bgp routing dynamics is critical to the solid growth and maintenance of the internet routing infrastructure however while the most extensive study on bgp dynamics is nearly decade old many factors that could affect bgp dynamics have changed considerably we revisit this important topic in this paper focusing on not only comparing with the previous results but also issues not well explored before we have found that compared to almost decade ago although certain characteristics remain unchanged such as some temporal properties bgp dynamics are now busier and more importantly now have much less pathological behavior and are healthierâ for example forwarding dynamics are now not only dominant but also more consistent across different days contributions to bgp dynamics by different bgp peersâ which are not proportional to the size of peerâ asâ are also more stable and dynamics due to policy changes or duplicate announcements are usually from specific peers

most existing pp networks route requests in kn log log log hops where is the number of participating nodes and is an adjustable parameter although some can achieve hop routing for constant by tuning the parameter the neighbor locations however become function of causing considerable maintenance overhead if the user base is highly dynamic as witnessed by the deployed systems this paper explores the design space using the simple uniformly random neighbor selection strategy and proposes random peer to peer network that is the first of its kind to resolve requests in hops with chosen probability of where is constant the number of neighbors per node is within constant factor from the optimal complexity for any network whose routing paths are bounded by hops
mails concerning the development issues of system constitute an important source of information about high level design decisions low level implementation concerns and the social structure of developers establishing links between mails and the software artifacts they discuss is non trivial problem due to the inherently informal nature of human communication different approaches can be brought into play to tackle this trace ability issue but the question of how they can be evaluated remains unaddressed as there is no recognized benchmark against which they can be compared in this article we present such benchmark which we created through the manual inspection of statistically significant number of mails pertaining to six unrelated software systems we then use our benchmark to measure the effectiveness of number of approaches ranging from lightweight approaches based on regular expressions to full fledged information retrieval approaches

frequent pattern mining is popular topic in data mining with the advance of this technique privacy issues attract more and more attention in recent years in this field previous works based hiding sensitive information on uniform support threshold or disclosure threshold however in practical applications we probably need to apply different support thresholds to different itemsets for reflecting their significance in this paper we propose new hiding strategy to protect sensitive frequent patterns with multiple sensitive thresholds based on different sensitive thresholds the sanitized dataset is able to highly fulfill user requirements in real applications while preserving more information of the original dataset empirical studies show that our approach can protect sensitive knowledge well not only under multiple thresholds but also under uniform threshold moreover the quality of the sanitized dataset can be maintained
web page classification is one of the essential techniques for web mining specifically classifying web pages of user interesting class is the first step of mining interesting information from the web however constructing classifier for an interesting class requires laborious pre processing such as collecting positive and negative training examples for instance in order to construct homepage classifier one needs to collect sample of homepages positive examples and sample of non homepages negative examples in particular collecting negative training examples requires arduous work and special caution to avoid biasing them we introduce in this paper the positive example based learning pebl framework for web page classification which eliminates the need for manually collecting negative training examples in pre processing we present an algorithm called mapping convergence that achieves classification accuracy with positive and unlabeled data as high as that of traditional svm with positive and negative data our experiments show that when the algorithm uses the same amount of positive examples as that of traditional svm the algorithm performs as well as traditional svm
since software systems need to be continuously available under varying conditions their ability to evolve at runtime is increasingly seen as one key issue modern programming frameworks already provide support for dynamic adaptations however the high variability of features in dynamic adaptive systems das introduces an explosion of possible runtime system configurations often called modes and mode transitions designing these configurations and their transitions is tedious and error prone making the system feature evolution difficult while aspect oriented modeling aom was introduced to improve the modularity of software this paper presents how an aom approach can be used to tame the combinatorial explosion of das modes using aom techniques we derive wide range of modes by weaving aspects into an explicit model reflecting the runtime system we use these generated modes to automatically adapt the system we validate our approach on an adaptive middleware for home automation currently deployed in rennes metropolis

this paper examines some issues that affect the efficiency and fairness of the transmission control protocol tcp the backbone of internet protocol communication in multihops satellite network systems it proposes scheme that allows satellite systems to automatically adapt to any change in the number of active tcp flows due to handover occurrence the free buffer size and the bandwidth delay product of the networkthe proposed scheme has two major design goals increasing the system efficiency and improving its fairness the system efficiency is controlled by matching the aggregate traffic rate to the sum of the link capacity and total buffer size on the other hand the system min max fairness is achieved by allocating bandwidth among individual flows in proportion with their rtts the proposed scheme is dubbed recursive explicit and fair window adjustment refwa simulation results elucidate that the refwa scheme substantially improves the system fairness reduces the number of packet drops and makes better utilization of the bottleneck link the results demonstrate also that the proposed scheme works properly in more complicated environments where connections traverse multiple bottlenecks and the available bandwidth may change over data transmission time
propositional satisfiability solving or sat is an important reasoning task arising in numerous applications such as circuit design formal verification planning scheduling or probabilistic reasoning the depth first search dpll procedure is in practice the most efficient complete algorithm to date previous studies have shown the theoretical and experimental advantages of decomposing propositional formulas to guide the ordering of variable instantiation in dpll however in practice the computation of tree decomposition may require considerable amount of time and space on large formulas existing decomposition tools are unable to handle most currently challenging sat instances because of their size in this paper we introduce simple fast and scalable method to quickly produce tree decompositions of large sat problems we show experimentally the efficiency of orderings derived from these decompositions on the solving of challenging benchmarks

the assumption of routing symmetry is often embedded into traffic analysis and classification tools this paper uses passively captured network data to estimate the amount of traffic actually routed symmetrically on specific link we propose flow based symmetry estimator fse set of metrics to assess symmetry in terms of flows packets and bytes which disregards inherently asymmetrical traffic such as udp icmp and tcp background radiation this normalized metric allows fair comparison of symmetry across different links we evaluate our method on large heterogeneous dataset and confirm anecdotal reports that routing symmetry typically does not hold for non edge internet links and decreases as one moves toward core backbone links due to routing policy complexity our proposed metric for traffic asymmetry induced by routing policies will help the community improve traffic characterization techniques and formats but also support quantitative formalization of routing policy effects on links in the wild

in previous work we have designed tracking protocol stalk for wireless sensor networks and proved it to be self stabilizing at the pseudo code automata level however it is very challenging to achieve and verify self stabilization of the same protocol at the implementation tinyos level due to the size of the corresponding program at the implementation level in this paper we present lightweight and practical method for specification based design of stabilization and illustrate this method on the stalk protocol as our case study
the analysis of large execution traces is almost impossible without efficient tool support lately there has been an increase in the number of tools for analyzing traces generated from object oriented systems this interest has been driven by the fact that polymorphism and dynamic binding pose serious limitations to static analysis however most of the techniques supported by existing tools are found in the context of very specific visualization schemes which makes them hard to reuse it is also very common to have two different tools implement the same techniques using different terminology this appears to result from the absence of common framework for trace analysis approaches this paper presents the state of the art in the area of trace analysis we do this by analyzing the techniques that are supported by eight trace exploration tools we also discuss their advantages and limitations and how they can be improved
context aware application in the pervasive computing environment provides intuitive user centric services using implicit context cues personalization and control are important issues for this class of application as they enable end users to understand and configure the behavior of an application however most development efforts for building context aware applications focus on the sensor fusion and machine learning algorithms to generate and distribute context cues that drive the application with little emphasis on user centric issues we argue that to elevate user experiences with context aware applications it is very important to address these personalization and control issues at the system interface level in parallel to context centric design towards this direction we present persona toolkit that provides support for extending context aware applications with end user personalization and control features specifically persona exposes few application programming interfaces that abstract end user customization and control mechanisms and enables developers to integrate these user centric aspects with rest of the application seamlessly there are two primary advantages of persona first it can be used with various existing middlewares as ready to use plug in to build customizable and controllable context aware applications second existing context aware applications can easily be augmented to provide end user personalization and control support in this paper we discuss the design and implementation of persona and demonstrate its usefulness through the development and augmentation of range of common context aware applications
most file systems attempt to predict which disk blocks will be needed in the near future and prefetch them into memory this technique can improve application throughput as much as but why the reasons include that the disk cache comes into play the device driver amortizes the fixed cost of an operation over larger amount of data total disk seek time can be decreased and that programs can overlap computation and however intuition does not tell us the relative benefit of each of these causes or techniques for increasing the effectiveness of prefetching to answer these questions we constructed an analytic performance model for file system reads the model is based on bsd derived file system and parameterized by the access patterns of the files layout of files on disk and the design characteristics of the file system and of the underlying disk we then validated the model against several simple workloads the predictions of our model were typically within of measured values and differed at most by from measured values using the model and experiments we explain why and when prefetching works and make proposals for how to tune file system and disk parameters to improve overall system throughput

increasing risks of spoof attacks and other common problems of unimodal biometric systems such as intra class variations non universality and noisy data necessitate the use of multimodal biometrics the face and the ear are highly attractive biometric traits for combination because of their physiological structure and location besides both of them can be acquired non intrusively however changes of facial expressions variations in pose scale and illumination and the presence of hair and ornaments present some genuine challenges in this paper local feature based approach is proposed to fuse ear and face biometrics at the score level experiments with frgc and the university of notre dame biometric databases show that the technique achieves an identification rate of and verification rate of at far for fusion of the ear with neutral face biometrics it is also found to be fast and robust to facial expressions achieving and identification and verification rates respectively

this paper describes new hierarchical approach to content based image retrieval called the customized queries approach cqa contrary to the single feature vector approach which tries to classify the query and retrieve similar images in one step cqa uses multiple feature sets and two step approach to retrieval the first step classifies the query according to the class labels of the images using the features that best discriminate the classes the second step then retrieves the most similar images within the predicted class using the features customized to distinguish subclasses within that class needing to find the customized feature subset for each class led us to investigate feature selection for unsupervised learning as result we developed new algorithm called fssem feature subset selection using expectation maximization clustering we applied our approach to database of high resolution computed tomography lung images and show that cqa radically improves the retrieval precision over the single feature vector approach to determine whether our cbir system is helpful to physicians we conducted an evaluation trial with eight radiologists the results show that our system using cqa retrieval doubled the doctors diagnostic accuracy
blind scheduling policies schedule tasks without knowledge of the tasks remaining processing times existing blind policies such as fcfs ps and las have proven useful in network and operating system applications but each policy has separate vastly differing description leading to separate and distinct implementations this paper presents the design and implementation of configurable blind scheduler that contains continuous tunable parameter by merely changing the value of this parameter the scheduler's policy exactly emulates or closely approximates several existing standard policies other settings enable policies whose behavior is hybrid of these standards we demonstrate the practical benefits of such configurable scheduler by implementing it into the linux operating system we show that we can emulate the behavior of linux's existing more complex scheduler with single hybrid setting of the parameter we also show using synthetic workloads that the best value for the tunable parameter is not unique but depends on distribution of the size of tasks arriving to the system finally we use our formulation of the configurable scheduler to contrast the behavior of various blind schedulers by exploring how various properties of the scheduler change as we vary our scheduler's tunable parameter

as massively parallel computers proliferate there is growing interest in finding ways by which performance of massively parallel codes can be efficiently predicted this problem arises in diverse contexts such as parallelizing compilers parallel performance monitoring and parallel algorithm development in this paper we describe one solution where one directly executes the application code but uses discrete event simulator to model details of the presumed parallel machine such as operating system and communication network behavior because this approach is computationally expensive we are interested in its own parallelization specifically the parallelization of the discrete event simulator we describe methods suitable for parallelized direct execution simulation of message passing parallel programs and report on the performance of such system lapse large application parallel simulation environment we have built on the intel paragon on all codes measured to date lapse predicts performance well typically within relative error depending on the nature of the application code we have observed low slowdowns relative to natively executing code and high relative speedups using up to processors
formal verification techniques are not yet widely used in the software industry perhaps because software tends to be more complex than hardware and the penalty for bugs is often lower software can be patched after the release instead large amount of time and money is being spent on software testing which misses many subtle errors especially in concurrent programs increased use of concurrency eg due to the popularity of web services and the surge of complex viruses which exploit security vulnerabilities of software make the problem of creating verifying compiler for production quality code essential and urgent
multimedia and network processing applications make extensive use of subword data since registers are capable of holding full data word when subword variable is assigned register only part of the register is used new embedded processors have started supporting instruction sets that allow direct referencing of bit sections within registers and therefore multiple subword variables can be made to simultaneously reside in the same register without hindering accesses to these variables however new register allocation algorithm is needed that is aware of the bitwidths of program variables and is capable of packing multiple subword variables into single register this paper presents one such algorithmthe algorithm we propose has two key steps first combination of forward and backward data flow analyses are developed to determine the bitwidths of program variables throughout the program this analysis is required because the declared bitwidths of variables are often larger than their true bitwidths and moreover the minimal bitwidths of program variable can vary from one program point to another second novel interference graph representation is designed to enable support for fast and highly accurate algorithm for packing of subword variables into single register packing is carried out by node coalescing phase that precedes the conventional graph coloring phase of register allocation in contrast to traditional node coalescing packing coalesces set of interfering nodes our experiments show that our bitwidth aware register allocation algorithm reduces the register requirements by to over traditional register allocation algorithm that assigns separate registers to simultaneously live subword variables
the core task of sponsored search is to retrieve relevant ads for the user's query ads can be retrieved either by exact match when their bid term is identical to the query or by advanced match which indexes ads as documents and is similar to standard information retrieval ir recently there has been great deal of research into developing advanced match ranking algorithms however no previous research has addressed the ad indexing problem unlike most traditional search problems the ad corpus is defined hierarchically in terms of advertiser accounts campaigns and ad groups which further consist of creatives and bid terms this hierarchical structure makes indexing highly non trivial as naively indexing all possible displayable ads leads to prohibitively large and ineffective index we show that ad retrieval using such an index is not only slow but its precision is suboptimal as well we investigate various strategies for compact hierarchy aware indexing of sponsored search ads through adaptation of standard ir indexing techniques we also propose new ad retrieval method that yields more relevant ads by exploiting the structured nature of the ad corpus experiments carried out over large ad test collection from commercial search engine show that our proposed methods are highly effective and efficient compared to more standard indexing and retrieval approaches
existing methods for measuring the quality of search algorithms use static collection of documents set of queries and mapping from the queries to the relevant documents allow the experimenter to see how well different search engines or engine configurations retrieve the correct answers this methodology assumes that the document set and thus the set of relevant documents are unchanging in this paper we abandon the static collection requirement we begin with recent trec collection created from web crawl and analyze how the documents in that collection have changed over time we determine how decay of the document collection affects trec systems and present the results of an experiment using the decayed collection to measure live web search system we employ novel measures of search effectiveness that are robust despite incomplete relevance information lastly we propose methodology of collection maintenance which supports measuring search performance both for single system and between systems run at different points in time
xml has tree structured data model which is used to uniformly represent structured as well as semi structured data and also enable concise query specification in xquery via the use of its xpath twig patterns this in turn can leverage the recently developed technology of structural join algorithms to evaluate the query efficiently in this paper we identify fundamental tension in xml data modeling data represented as deep trees which can make effective use of twig patterns are often un normalized leading to update anomalies while ii normalized data tends to be shallow resulting in heavy use of expensive value based joins in queriesour solution to this data modeling problem is novel multi colored trees mct logical data model which is an evolutionary extension of the xml data model and permits trees with multi colored nodes to signify their participation in multiple hierarchies this adds significant semantic structure to individual data nodes we extend xquery expressions to navigate between structurally related nodes taking color into account and also to create new colored trees as restructurings of an mct database while mct serves as significant evolutionary extension to xml as logical data model one of the key roles of xml is for information exchange to enable exchange of mct information we develop algorithms for optimally serializing an mct database as xml we discuss alternative physical representations for mct databases using relational and native xml databases and describe an implementation on top of the timber native xml database experimental evaluation using our prototype implementation shows that not only are mct queries updates more succinct and easier to express than equivalent shallow tree xml queries but they can also be significantly more efficient to evaluate than equivalent deep and shallow tree xml queries updates
the large address space needs of many current applications have pushed processor designs toward bit word widths although full bit addresses and operations are indeed sometimes needed arithmetic operations on much smaller quantities are still more common in fact another instruction set trend has been the introduction of instructions geared toward subword operations on bit quantities for examples most major processors now include instruction set support for multimedia operations allowing parallel execution of several subword operations in the same alu this article presents our observations demonstrating that operations on ldquo narrow width rdquo quantities are common not only in multimedia codes but also in more general workloads in fact across the specint benchmarks over half the integer operation executions require bits or less based on this data we propose two hardware mechanisms that dynamically recognize and capitalize on these narrow width operations the first power oriented optimization reduces processor power consumption by using operand value based clock gating to turn off portions of arithmetic units that will be unused by narrow width operations this optimization results in reduction in the integer unit's power consumption for the specint and mediabench benchmark suites applying this optimization to specfp benchmarks results in slightly smaller power reductions but still seems warranted these reductions in integer unit power consumption equate to full chip power savings our second performance oriented optimization improves processor performance by packing together narrow width operations so that they share single arithmetic unit conceptually similar to dynamic form of mmx this optimization offers speedups of for specint and for mediabench overall these optimizations highlight an increasing opportunity for value based optimizations to improve both power and performance in current microprocessors

context sensitive points to analysis maintains separate points to relationships for each possible abstract calling context of method previous work has shown that large number of equivalence classes exists in the representation of calling contexts such equivalent contexts provide opportunities for context sensitive analyses based on binary decision diagrams bdds in which bdds automatically merge equivalent points to relationships however the use of bdd black box introduces additional overhead for analysis running time furthermore with heap cloning ie using context sensitive object allocation sites bdds are not as effective because the number of equivalence classes increases significantly further step must be taken to look inside the bdd black box to investigate where the equivalence comes from and what tradeoffs can be employed to enable practical large scale heap cloning this paper presents an analysis for java that exploits equivalence classes in context representation for particular pointer variable or heap object all abstract contexts within an equivalence class can be merged this technique naturally results in new non bdd context sensitive points to analysis based on these equivalence classes the analysis employs last substring merging approach to define scalability and precision tradeoffs we show that small values for can enable scalable heap cloning for large java programs the proposed analysis has been implemented and evaluated on large set of java programs the experimental results show improvements over an existing object sensitive analysis with heap cloning which is the most precise scalable analysis implemented in the state of the art paddle analysis framework for computing points to solution for an entire program our approach is an order of magnitude faster compared to this bdd based analysis and to related non bdd refinement based analysis
consequence of ilp systems being implemented in prolog or using prolog libraries is that usually these systems use prolog internal database to store and manipulate data however in real world problems the original data is rarely in prolog format in fact the data is often kept in relational database management systems rdbms and then converted to format acceptable by the ilp system therefore more interesting approach is to link the ilp system to the rdbms and manipulate the data without converting it this scheme has the advantage of being more scalable since the whole data does not need to be loaded into memory by the ilp system in this paper we study several approaches of coupling ilp systems with rdbms systems and evaluate their impact on performance we propose to use deductive database ddb system to transparently translate the hypotheses to relational algebra expressions the empirical evaluation performed shows that the execution time of ilp algorithms can be effectively reduced using ddb and that the size of the problems can be increased due to non memory storage of the data
deployments of wireless lans consisting of hundreds of access points with large number of users have been reported in enterprises as well as college campuses however due to the unreliable nature of wireless links users frequently encounter degraded performance and lack of coverage this problem is even worse in unplanned networks such as the numerous access points deployed by homeowners existing approaches that aim to diagnose these problems are inefficient because they troubleshoot at too high level and are unable to distinguish among the root causes of degradation this paper designs implements and tests fine grained detection algorithms that are capable of distinguishing between root causes of wireless anomalies at the depth of the physical layer an important property that emerges from our system is that diagnostic observations are combined from multiple sources over multiple time instances for improved accuracy and efficiency

two key steps in the compilation of strict functional languages are the conversion of higher order functions to data structures closures and the transformation to tail recursive style we show how to perform both steps at once by applying first order offline partial evaluation to suitable interpreter the resulting code is easy to transliterate to low level or native code we have implemented the compilation to it yields performance comparable to that of other modern scheme to compilers in addition we have integrated various optimizations such as constant propagation higher order removal and arity raising simply by modifying the underlying interpreter purely first order methods suffice to achieve the transformations our approach is an instance of semantics directed compiler generation

novel face recognition algorithm based on gabor texture information is proposed in this paper two kinds of strategies to capture it are introduced gabor magnitude based texture representation gmtr and gabor phase based texture representation gptr specifically gmtr is characterized by using the gamma density to model the gabor magnitude distribution while gptr is characterized by using the generalized gaussian density ggd to model the gabor phase distribution the estimated model parameters serve as texture representation experiments are performed on yale orl and feret databases to validate the feasibility of the proposed method the results show that the proposed gmtr based and gptr based nlda both significantly outperform the widely used gabor features based nlda and other existing subspace methods in addition the feature level fusion of these two kinds of texture representations performs better than them individually
we propose novel privacy preserving distributed infrastructure in which data resides only with the publishers owning it the infrastructure disseminates user queries to publishers who answer them at their own discretion the infrastructure enforces publisher anonymity guarantee which prevents leakage of information about which publishers are capable of answering certain query given the virtual nature of the global data collection we study the challenging problem of efficiently locating publishers in the community that contain data items matching specified query we propose distributed index structure uqdt that is organized as union of query dissemination trees qdts and realized on an overlay ie logical network infrastructure each qdt has data publishers as its leaf nodes and overlay network nodes as its internal nodes each internal node routes queries to publishers based on summary of the data advertised by publishers in its subtrees we experimentally evaluate design tradeoffs and demonstrate that uqdt can maximize throughput by preventing any overlay network node from becoming bottleneck

program slicing systematically identifies parts of program relevant to seed statement unfortunately slices of modern programs often grow too large for human consumption we argue that unwieldy slices arise primarily from an overly broad definition of relevance rather than from analysis imprecision while traditional slice includes all statements that may affect point of interest not all such statements appear equally relevant to human as an improved method of finding relevant statements we propose thin slicing thin slice consists only of producer statements for the seed ie those statements that help compute and copy avalue to the seed statements that explain why producers affect the seed are excluded for example for seed that reads value from container object thin slice includes statements that store the value into the container but excludes statements that manipulate pointers to the container itself thin slices can also be hierarchically expanded to include statements explaining how producers affect the seed yielding traditional slice in the limit we evaluated thin slicing for set of debugging and program understanding tasks the evaluation showed that thin slices usually included the desired statements for the tasks eg the buggy statement for debugging task furthermore in simulated use of slicing tool thin slices revealed desired statements after inspecting times fewer statements than traditional slicing for our debugging tasks and times fewer statements for our program understanding tasks finally our thin slicing algorithm scales well to relatively large java benchmarks suggesting that thin slicing represents an attractive option for practical tools
reconfigurable hardware is ideal for use in systems on chip soc as it provides both hardware level performance and post fabrication flexibility however any one architecture is rarely equally optimized for all applications socs targeting specific set of applications can greatly benefit from incorporating customized reconfigurable logic instead of generic field programmable gate array fpga logic unfortunately manually designing domain specific architecture for every soc would require significant design time instead this paper discusses our initial efforts towards creating reconfigurable hardware generator capable of automatically creating flexible yet domain specific designs our tests indicate that our generated architectures are more than smaller than equivalent fpga implementations and nearly as area efficient as standard cell designs we also use novel technique employing synthetic circuit generation to demonstrate the flexibility of our architecture generation techniques
from personal software to advanced systems caching mechanisms have steadfastly been ubiquitous means for reducing workloads it is no surprise then that under the grid and cluster paradigms middlewares and other large scale applications often seek caching solutions among these distributed applications scientific workflow management systems have gained ground towards mitigating the often painstaking process of composing sequences of scientific data sets and services to derive virtual data in the past workflow managers have relied on low level system cache for reuse support but in distributed query intensive environments where high volumes of intermediate virtual data can potentially be stored anywhere on the grid novel cache structure is needed to efficiently facilitate workflow planning in this paper we describe an approach to combat the challenges of maintaining large fast virtual data caches for workflow composition hierarchical structure is proposed for indexing scientific data with spatiotemporal annotations across grid nodes our experimental results show that our hierarchical index is scalable and outperforms centralized indexing scheme by an exponential factor in query intensive environments
at the highest level of formal certification the current research trend consists in providing evaluators with formal checkable proof produced by automatic verification tools the aim is to reduce the certification process to verifying the provided proof using proof checker however to date no certified proof checker has emerged in addition checkable proofs do not eliminate the need to validate the formalization of the verification problem in this paper we consider the point of view of evaluators we elaborate criteria that must be fulfilled by formal proof in order to convince skeptical evaluators then we present methodology based on this notion of convincing proofs that requires simple formalizations to reach the level of confidence of formal certification the key idea is to build certified proof checker in collaboration with the evaluators which is finally used to validate the proof provided by developers we illustrate our approach on the correctness proof of buffering protocol written in that manages the data exchanges between concurrent tasks in avionics control systems
nowadays grid computing has been widely recognized as the next big thing in distributed software development grid technologies allow developers to implement massively distributed applications with enormous demands for resources such as processing power data and network bandwidth despite the important benefits grid computing offers contemporary approaches for grid enabling applications still force developers to invest much effort into manually providing code to discover and access grid resources and services moreover the outcome of this task is usually software that is polluted by grid aware code as result of which the maintainability suffers in previous article we presented jgrim novel approach to easily gridify java applications in this paper we report detailed evaluation of jgrim that was conducted by comparing it with ibis and proactive two platforms for grid development specifically we used these three platforms for gridifying the nearest neighbor algorithm and an application for restoring panoramic images the results show that jgrim simplifies gridification without resigning performance for these applications

in wireless sensor networks one of the main design challenges is to save severely constrained energy resources and obtain long system lifetime low cost of sensors enables us to randomly deploy large number of sensor nodes thus potential approach to solve lifetime problem arises that is to let sensors work alternatively by identifying redundant nodes in high density networks and assigning them an off duty operation mode that has lower energy consumption than the normal on duty mode in single wireless sensor network sensors are performing two operations sensing and communication therefore there might exist two kinds of redundancy in the network most of the previous work addressed only one kind of redundancy sensing or communication alone wang et al intergrated coverage and connectivity configuration in wireless sensor networks in proceedings of the first acm conference on embedded networked sensor systems sensys los angeles november and zhang and hou maintaining sensing coverage and connectivity in large sensor networks technical report uiucdcs june first discussed how to combine consideration of coverage and connectivity maintenance in single activity scheduling they provided sufficient condition for safe scheduling integration in those fully covered networks however random node deployment often makes initial sensing holes inside the deployed area inevitable even in an extremely high density network therefore in this paper we enhance their work to support general wireless sensor networks by proving another conclusion the communication range is twice of the sensing range is the sufficient condition and the tight lower bound to ensure that complete coverage preservation implies connectivity among active nodes if the original network topology consisting of all the deployed nodes is connected also we extend the result to degree network connectivity and degree coverage preservation
geospatial data play key role in wide spectrum of critical data management applications such as disaster and emergency management environmental monitoring land and city planning and military operations often requiring the coordination among diverse organizations their data repositories and users with different responsibilities although variety of models and techniques are available to manage access and share geospatial data very little attention has been paid to addressing security concerns such as access control security and privacy policies and the development of secure and in particular interoperable gis applications the objective of this paper is to discuss the technical challenges raised by the unique requirements of secure geospatial data management and to suggest comprehensive framework for security and privacy for geospatial data and gis such framework is the first coherent architectural approach to the problem of security and privacy for geospatial data
in virtual machines for embedded devices that use just in time compilation the management of the code cache can significantly impact performance in terms of both memory usage and start up time although improving memory usage has been common focus for system designers start up time is often overlooked in systems with constrained resources however these two performance metrics are often at odds and must be considered together in this paper we present an adaptive self adjusting code cache manager to improve performance with respect to both start up time and memory usage it balances these concerns by detecting changes in method compilation rates resizing the cache after each pitching event we conduct experiments to validate our proposed system and quantify the impacts that different code cache management techniques have on memory usage and start up time through two oracle systems our results show that the proposed algorithm yields nearly the same start up times as hand tuned oracle and shorter execution times than those of the sscli in eight out of ten applications it also has lower memory usage over time in all but one application

online transaction processing oltp databases include suite of features disk resident trees and heap files locking based concurrency control support for multi threading that were optimized for computer technology of the late advances in modern processors memories and networks mean that today's computers are vastly different from those of years ago such that many oltp databases will now fit in main memory and most oltp transactions can be processed in milliseconds or less yet database architecture has changed little based on this observation we look at some interesting variants of conventional database systems that one might build that exploit recent hardware trends and speculate on their performance through detailed instruction level breakdown of the major components involved in transaction processing database system shore running subset of tpc rather than simply profiling shore we progressively modified it so that after every feature removal or optimization we had faster working system that fully ran our workload overall we identify overheads and optimizations that explain total difference of about factor of in raw performance we also show that there is no single high pole in the tent in modern memory resident database systems but that substantial time is spent in logging latching locking tree and buffer management operations
traditionally clock network layout is performed after cell placement such methodology is facing serious problem in nanometer ic designs where people tend to use huge clock buffers for robustness against variations that is clock buffers are often placed far from ideal locations to avoid overlap with logic cells as result both power dissipation and timing are degraded in order to solve this problem we propose low power clock buffer planning methodology which is integrated with cell placement bin divided grouping algorithm is developed to construct virtual buffer tree which can explicitly model the clock buffers in placement the virtual buffer tree is dynamically updated during the placement to reflect the changes of latch locations to reduce power dissipation latch clumping is incorporated with the clock buffer planning the experimental results show that our method can reduce clock power significantly by on average

the increasing use of computers for saving valuable data imposes stringent reliability constraints on storage systems reliability improvement via use of redundancy is common practice as the disk capacity improves advanced techniques such as disk scrubbing are being employed to proactively fix latent sector errors these techniques utilize the disk idle time for reliability improvement however the idle time is key to dynamic energy management that detects such idle periods and turns off the disks to save energy in this paper we are concerned with the distribution of the disk idle periods between reliability and energy management tasks for this purpose we define new metric energy reliability product erp to capture the effect of one technique on the other our initial investigation using trace driven simulations of typical enterprise applications shows that the erp is suitable metric for identifying efficient idle period utilization thus erp can facilitate development of systems that provide both reliability and energy managements

databases are increasingly being used to store multi media objects such as maps images audio and video storage and retrieval of these objects is accomplished using multi dimensional index structures such as trees and ss trees as dimensionality increases query performance in these index structures degrades this phenomenon generally referred to as the dimensionality curse can be circumvented by reducing the dimensionality of the data such reduction is however accompanied by loss of precision of query results current techniques such as qbic use svd transform based dimensionality reduction to ensure high query precision the drawback of this approach is that svd is expensive to compute and therefore not readily applicable to dynamic databases in this paper we propose novel techniques for performing svd based dimensionality reduction in dynamic databases when the data distribution changes considerably so as to degrade query precision we recompute the svd transform and incorporate it in the existing index structure for recomputing the svd transform we propose novel technique that uses aggregate data from the existing index rather than the entire data this technique reduces the svd computation time without compromising query precision we then explore efficient ways to incorporate the recomputed svd transform in the existing index structure without degrading subsequent query response times these techniques reduce the computation time by factor of in experiments on color and texture image vectors the error due to approximate computation of svd is less than

this paper describes new framework of register allocation based on chaitin style coloring our focus is on maximizing the chances for live ranges to be allocated to the most preferred registers while not destroying the colorability obtained by graph simplification our coloring algorithm uses graph representation of preferences called register preference graph which helps find good register selection we then try to relax the register selection order created by the graph simplification the relaxed order is defined as partial order represented using graph called coloring precedence graph our algorithm utilizes such partial order for the register selection instead of using the traditional simplification driven order so that the chances of honoring the preferences are effectively increased experimental results show that our coloring algorithm is powerful to simultaneously handle spill decisions register coalescing and preference resolutions
statistical language models have been successfully applied to many information retrieval tasks including expert finding the process of identifying experts given particular topic in this paper we introduce and detail language modeling approaches that integrate the representation association and search of experts using various textual data sources into generative probabilistic framework this provides simple intuitive and extensible theoretical framework to underpin research into expertise search to demonstrate the flexibility of the framework two search strategies to find experts are modeled that incorporate different types of evidence extracted from the data before being extended to also incorporate co occurrence information the models proposed are evaluated in the context of enterprise search systems within an intranet environment where it is reasonable to assume that the list of experts is known and that data to be mined is publicly accessible our experiments show that excellent performance can be achieved by using these models in such environments and that this theoretical and empirical work paves the way for future principled extensions

system area networks sans which usually accept arbitrary topologies have been used to connect hosts in pc clusters although deadlock free routing is often employed for low latency communications using wormhole or virtual cut through switching the interconnection adaptivity introduces difficulties in establishing deadlock free paths an up down routing algorithm which has been widely used to avoid deadlocks in irregular networks tends to make unbalanced paths as it employs one dimensional directed graph the current study introduces two dimensional directed graph on which adaptive routings called left up first turn turn routings and right down last turn turn routings are proposed to make the paths as uniformly distributed as possible this scheme guarantees deadlock freedom because it uses the turn model approach and the extra degree of freedom in the two dimensional graph helps to ensure that the prohibited turns are well distributed simulation results show that better throughput and latency results from uniformly distributing the prohibited turns by which the traffic would be more distributed toward the leaf nodes the turn routings which meet this condition improve throughput by up to percent compared with two up down based routings and also reduce latency
optimal data placement on clv constant linear velocity format optical discs has an objective the minimization of the expected access cost of data retrievals from the disc when the probabilities of access of data items may be different the problem of optimal data placement for optical discs is both important and more difficult than the corresponding problem on magnetic discs good data placement on optical discs is more important because data sets on optical discs such as worm and cd rom cannot be modified or moved once they are placed on disc currently even rewritable optical discs are best suited for applications that are archival in nature the problem of optimal data placement on clv format optical discs is more difficult mainly because the useful storage space is not uniformly distributed across the disc surface along the radius this leads to complicated positional performance trade off not present for magnetic disks we present model that encompasses all the important aspects of the placement problem on clv format optical discs the model takes into account the nonuniform distribution of useful storage the dependency of the rotational delay on disc position parameterized seek cost function for optical discs and the varying access probabilities of data items we show that the optimal placement of high probability blocks satisfies unimodality property based on this observation we solve the optimal placement problem we then study the impact of the relative weights of the problem parameters and show that the optimal data placement may be very different from the optimal data placement on magnetic disks we also validate our model and analysis and give an algorithm for computing the placement of disc sectors

the most expressive way humans display emotions is through facial expressions in this work we report on several advances we have made in building system for classification of facial expressions from continuous video input we introduce and test different bayesian network classifiers for classifying expressions from video focusing on changes in distribution assumptions and feature dependency structures in particular we use naive bayes classifiers and change the distribution from gaussian to cauchy and use gaussian tree augmented naive bayes tan classifiers to learn the dependencies among different facial motion features we also introduce facial expression recognition from live video input using temporal cues we exploit the existing methods and propose new architecture of hidden markov models hmms for automatically segmenting and recognizing human facial expression from video sequences the architecture performs both segmentation and recognition of the facial expressions automatically using multi level architecture composed of an hmm layer and markov model layer we explore both person dependent and person independent recognition of expressions and compare the different methods
we study the size of memory of mobile agents that permits to solve deterministically the rendezvous problem ie the task of meeting at some node for two identical agents moving from node to node along the edges of an unknown anonymous connected graph the rendezvous problem is unsolvable in the class of arbitrary connected graphs as witnessed by the example of the cycle hence we restrict attention to rendezvous in trees where rendezvous is feasible if and only if the initial positions of the agents are not symmetric we prove that the minimum memory size guaranteeing rendezvous in all trees of size at most is logn bits the upper bound is provided by an algorithm for abstract state machines accomplishing rendezvous in all trees and using logn bits of memory in trees of size at most the lower bound is consequence of the need to distinguish between up to links incident to node thus in the second part of the paper we focus on the potential existence of pairs of finite agents ie finite automata capable of accomplishing rendezvous in all bounded degree trees we show that as opposed to what has been proved for the graph exploration problem there are no finite agents capable of accomplishing rendezvous in all bounded degree trees
the compare and swap register cas is synchronization primitive for lock free algorithms most uses of it however suffer from the so called aba problem the simplest and most efficient solution to the aba problem is to include tag with the memory location such that the tag is incremented with each update of the target location this solution however is theoretically unsound and has limited applicability this paper presents general lock free pattern that is based on the synchronization primitive cas without causing aba problem or problems with wrap around it can be used to provide lock free functionality for any data type our algorithm is cas variation of herlihy's ll sc methodology for lock free transformation the basis of our techniques is to poll different locations on reading and writing objects in such way that the consistency of an object can be checked by its location instead of its tag it consists of simple code that can be easily implemented using like languages true problem of lock free algorithms is that they are hard to design correctly which even holds for apparently straightforward algorithms we therefore develop reduction theorem that enables us to reason about the general lock free algorithm to be designed on higher level than the synchronization primitives the reduction theorem is based on lamport's refinement mappings and has been verified with the higher order interactive theorem prover pvs using the reduction theorem fewer invariants are required and some invariants are easier to discover and formulate without considering the internal structure of the final implementation

bpql is novel query language for querying business process specifications introduced recently in it is based on an intuitive model of business processes as rewriting systems an abstraction of the emerging bpel business process execution language standard bpql allows users to query business processes visually in manner very analogous to the language used to specify the processes the goal of the present paper is to study the formal model underlying bpql and investigate its properties as well as the complexity of query evaluation we also study its relationship to previously suggested formalisms for process modeling and querying in particular we propose query evaluation algorithm of polynomial data complexity that can be applied uniformly to queries on the structure of the process specification as well as on the potential behavior of the defined process we show that unless np the efficiency of our algorithm is asymptotically optimal
objects often define usage protocols that clients must follow inorder for these objects to work properly aliasing makes itnotoriously difficult to check whether clients and implementations are compliant with such protocols accordingly existing approaches either operate globally or severely restrict aliasing we have developed sound modular protocol checking approach based on typestates that allows great deal of flexibility in aliasing while guaranteeing the absence of protocol violations at runtime the main technical contribution is novel abstraction access permissions that combines typestate and object aliasing information in our methodology developers express their protocol design intent through annotations based on access permissions our checking approach then tracks permissions through method implementations for each object reference the checker keeps track of the degree of possible aliasing and is appropriately conservativein reasoning about that reference this helps developers account for object manipulations that may occur through aliases the checking approach handles inheritance in novel way giving subclasses more flexibility in method overriding case studies on java iterators and streams provide evidence that access permissions can model realistic protocols and protocol checking based on access permissions can be used to reason precisely about the protocols that arise in practice
the goal of data integration is to provide uniform access to set of heterogeneous data sources freeing the user from the knowledge about where the data are how they are stored and how they can be accessed one of the outcomes of the research work carried out on data integration in the last years is clear architecture comprising global schema the source schema and the mapping between the source and the global schema although in many research works and commercial tools the global schema is simply data structure integrating the data at the sources we argue that the global schema should represent instead the conceptual model of the domain however to fully pursue such an approach several challenging issues are to be addressed the main goal of this paper is to analyze one of them namely how to express the conceptual model representing the global schema we start our analysis with the case where such schema is expressed in terms of uml class diagram and we end up with proposal of particular description logic called textit dl lite mathcal id we show that the data integration framework based on such logic has several interesting properties including the fact that both reasoning at design time and answering queries at run time can be done efficiently
with business emerging as key enabler to drive supply chains the focus of supply chain management has been shifted from production efficiency to customer driven and partnership synchronization approaches this strategic shift depends on the match between the demands and offerings that deliver the services to achieve this we need to coordinate the flow of information among the services and link their business processes under various constraints existing approaches to this problem have relied on complete information of services and resources and have failed to adequately address the dynamics and uncertainties of the operating environments the real world situation is complicated as result of undetermined requirements of services involved in the chain unpredictable solutions contributed by service providers and dynamic selection and aggregation of solutions to services this paper examines an agent mediated approach to on demand business supply chain integration each agent works as service broker exploring individual service decisions as well as interacting with each other for achieving compatibility and coherence among the decisions of all services based on the framework prototype has been implemented with simulated experiments highlighting the effectiveness of the approach
wireless network wlan provides unique challenges to system design wlan uses shared and highly unreliable medium where protocols must rely on precise timing of requests and responses to detect submission errors and priorities among network nodes in addition wlan stations are often embedded and have tight constraints on power costs and performance to design wlan nodes precise estimations on performance and resource usage are needed for the complete network system to explore the design space and assess the quality of solutions our systemclick framework combines systemc with resource models and performance annotations derived from actual implementations based on click model generation is automated and the performance of systemclick model is obtained depending on actual activation patterns of different functional blocks in the model case study demonstrates our approach for the analysis of real time critical systems
unexpected rules are interesting because they are either previously unknown or deviate from what prior user knowledge would suggest in this paper we study three important issues that have been previously ignored in mining unexpected rules first the unexpectedness of rule depends on how the user prefers to apply the prior knowledge to given scenario in addition to the knowledge itself second the prior knowledge should be considered right from the start to focus the search on unexpected rules third the unexpectedness of rule depends on what other rules the user has seen so far thus only rules that remain unexpected given what the user has seen should be considered interesting we develop an approach that addresses all three problems above and evaluate it by means of experiments focusing on finding interesting rules

this research investigates the work practices of system administrators using semi structured interviews and an analysis of existing system administrator literature we theorize that system administrators act as technical brokers who bridge two communities the end users they support and their own technical community we also show that system administrators like other technical workers rely on contextual knowledge this knowledge is largely acquired through practice and less through formal education and certification through discussion of common reactive and proactive system administrator duties we present system administrators as broker technicians who must mediate between the end users they support and their technical community we end with discussion of the changing role of sysadmins as their tools and users get more sophisticated
asymmetric broadband connections in the home provide limited upstream pipe to the internet this limitation makes various applications such as remote backup and sharing high definition video impractical however homes in neighborhood often have high bandwidth wireless networks whose bandwidth exceeds that of single wired uplink moreover most wired and wireless connections are idle most of the time in this paper we examine the fundamental requirements of system that aggregates upstream broadband connections in neighborhood using wireless communication between homes scheme addressing this problem must operate efficiently in an environment that is highly lossy ii broadcast in nature and iii half duplex we propose novel scheme link alike that addresses those three challenges using opportunistic wireless reception novel wireless broadcast rate control scheme and preferential use of the wired downlink through analytical and experimental evaluation we demonstrate that our approach provides significantly better throughput than previous solutions based on tcp or udp unicast
entity resolution er is the problem of identifying which records in database refer to the same real world entity an exhaustive er process involves computing the similarities between pairs of records which can be very expensive for large datasets various blocking techniques can be used to enhance the performance of er by dividing the records into blocks in multiple ways and only comparing records within the same block however most blocking techniques process blocks separately and do not exploit the results of other blocks in this paper we propose an iterative blocking framework where the er results of blocks are reflected to subsequently processed blocks blocks are now iteratively processed until no block contains any more matching records compared to simple blocking iterative blocking may achieve higher accuracy because reflecting the er results of blocks to other blocks may generate additional record matches iterative blocking may also be more efficient because processing block now saves the processing time for other blocks we implement scalable iterative blocking system and demonstrate that iterative blocking can be more accurate and efficient than blocking for large datasets

how to exploit application semantics to improve the performance of real time data intensive application has been an active research topic in the past few years weaker correctness criteria and semantics based concurrency control algorithms were proposed to provide more flexibility in reordering read and write events distinct from past work this paper exploits the trade off between data consistency and system workload the definition of similarity is combined with the idea of transaction skipping to provide theoretical foundation for reducing the workload of transaction system we also propose guidelines to adjust the execution frequencies of static set of transactions and prove their correctness the strengths of this work were verified by simulation experiments on an air traffic control example
we investigate the feasibility of reconstructing an arbitrarily shaped specular scene refractive or mirror like from one or more viewpoints by reducing shape recovery to the problem of reconstructing individual light paths that cross the image plane we obtain three key results first we show how to compute the depth map of specular scene from single viewpoint when the scene redirects incoming light just once second for scenes where incoming light undergoes two refractions or reflections we show that three viewpoints are sufficient to enable reconstruction in the general case third we show that it is impossible to reconstruct individual light paths when light is redirected more than twice our analysis assumes that for every point on the image plane we know at least one point on its light path this leads to reconstruction algorithms that rely on an environment matting procedure to establish pixel to point correspondences along light path preliminary results for variety of scenes mirror glass etc are also presented
the well accepted wisdom is that tcp's exponential backoff mechanism introduced by jacobson years ago is essential for preserving the stability of the internet in this paper we show that removing exponential backoff from tcp altogether can be done without inducing any stability side effects we introduce the implicit packet conservation principle and show that as long as the endpoints uphold this principle they can only improve their end to end performance relative to the exponential backoff case by conducting large scale simulations modeling and network experiments in emulab and the internet using kernel level freebsd tcp implementation realistic traffic distributions and complex network topologies we demonstrate that tcp's binary exponential backoff mechanism can be safely removed moreover we show that insuitability of tcp's exponential backoff is fundamental ie independent from the currently dominant internet traffic properties or bottleneck capacities surprisingly our results indicate that path to incrementally deploying the change does exist
in this paper we investigate whether it is possible to develop measure that quantifies the naturalness of human motion as defined by large database such measure might prove useful in verifying that motion editing operation had not destroyed the naturalness of motion capture clip or that synthetic motion transition was within the space of those seen in natural human motion we explore the performance of mixture of gaussians mog hidden markov models hmm and switching linear dynamic systems slds on this problem we use each of these statistical models alone and as part of an ensemble of smaller statistical models we also implement naive bayes nb model for baseline comparison we test these techniques on motion capture data held out from database keyframed motions edited motions motions with noise added and synthetic motion transitions we present the results as receiver operating characteristic roc curves and compare the results to the judgments made by subjects in user study
in these lecture notes we present the itasks system set of combinators to specify work flows in pure functional language at very high level of abstraction work flow systems are automated systems in which tasks are coordinated that have to be executed by either humans or computers the combinators that we propose support work flow patterns commonly found in commercial work flow systems in addition we introduce novel work flow patterns that capture real world requirements but that can not be dealt with by current systems compared with most of these commercial systems the itasks system offers several further advantages tasks are statically typed tasks can be higher order the combinators are fully compositional dynamic and recursive work flows can be specified and last but not least the specification is used to generate an executable web based multi user work flow application with the itasks system useful work flows can be defined which cannot be expressed in other systems work can be interrupted and subsequently directed to other workers for further processing the itasks system has been constructed in the programming language clean making use of its generic programming facilities and its idata toolkit with which interactive thin client form based web applications can be created in all itasks are an excellent case of the expressive power of functional and generic programming
in this paper we present perceptual experiment whose results aid the creation of non photorealistic rendering npr styles which can positively affect user task performance in real time scenes in visual search task designed to test people's perception of abstracted scenes different types of stylisation are used to investigate how reaction times can be affected we show how npr techniques compare against non stylised renderings compare the effectiveness of different styles determine how varying each style can affect performance and investigate how these styles perform with objects of varying complexity the results show that npr can be useful tool for increasing the saliency of target objects while reducing the visual impact of the rest of the scene however it is also shown that the success of each style depends largely on the scene context and also on the level of stylisation used we believe the results from this study can help in the creation of effective npr styles in the future supplementary material can be found at http isgcstcdie skrbal redmond
applications written in unsafe languages like and are vulnerable to memory errors such as buffer overflows dangling pointers and reads of uninitialized data such errors can lead to program crashes security vulnerabilities and unpredictable behavior we present diehard runtime system that tolerates these errors while probabilistically maintaining soundness diehard uses randomization and replication to achieve probabilistic memory safety by approximating an infinite sized heap diehard's memory manager randomizes the location of objects in heap that is at least twice as large as required this algorithm prevents heap corruption and provides probabilistic guarantee of avoiding memory errors for additional safety diehard can operate in replicated mode where multiple replicas of the same application are run simultaneously by initializing each replica with different random seed and requiring agreement on output the replicated version of die hard increases the likelihood of correct execution because errors are unlikely to have the same effect across all replicas we present analytical and experimental results that show diehard's resilience to wide range of memory errors including heap based buffer overflow in an actual application

in order to fulfill the complex resource requirements of some users in grid environments support for coallocation between different resource providers is needed here it is quite difficult to coordinate these different services from different resource providers because grid scheduler has to cope with different policies and objectives of the different resource providers and of the users agreement based resource management is considered feasible solution to solve many of these problems as it supports the reliable interaction between different providers and users however most current models do not well support co allocation here negotiation is needed to create such bi lateral agreements between several grid parties such negotiation process should be automated with no or minimal human interaction considering the potential scale of grid systems and the amount of necessary transactions therefore strategic negotiation models play an important role in this paper negotiation models which supports the co allocation between different resource providers are proposed and examined first simulations have been conducted to evaluate the presented system the results demonstrate that the proposed negotiation model are suitable and effective for grid environments

wireless sensor networks are resource constrained self organizing systems that are often deployed in inaccessible and inhospitable environments in order to collect data about some outside world phenomenon for most sensor network applications point to point reliability is not the main objective instead reliable event of interest delivery to the server needs to be guaranteed possibly with certain probability the nature of communication in sensor networks is unpredictable and failure prone even more so than in regular wireless ad hoc networks therefore it is essential to provide fault tolerant techniques for distributed sensor applications many recent studies in this area take drastically different approaches to addressing the fault tolerance issue in routing transport and or application layers in this paper we summarize and compare existing fault tolerant techniques to support sensor applications we also discuss several interesting open research directions

to efficiently deliver streaming media researchers have developed technical solutions that fall into three categories each of which has its merits and limitations infrastructure based cdns with dedicated network bandwidths and hardware supports can provide high quality streaming services but at high cost server based proxies are cost effective but not scalable due to the limited proxy capacity in storage and bandwidth and its centralized control also brings single point of failure client based pp networks are scalable but do not guarantee high quality streaming service due to the transient nature of peers to address these limitations we present novel and efficient design of scalable and reliable media proxy system assisted by pp networks called prop in the prop system the clients machines in an intranet are self organized into structured pp system to provide large media storage and to actively participate in the streaming media delivery where the proxy is also embedded as an important member to ensure the quality of streaming service the coordination and collaboration in the system are efficiently conducted by our pp management structure and replacement policies our system has the following merits it addresses both the scalability problem in centralized proxy systems and the unreliable service concern by only relying on the pp sharing of clients the proposed content locating scheme can timely serve the demanded media data and fairly dispatch media streaming tasks in appropriate granularity across the system based on the modeling and analysis we propose global replacement policies for proxy and clients which well balance the demand and supply of streaming data in the system achieving high utilization of peers cache we have comparatively evaluated our system through trace driven simulations with synthetic workloads and with real life workload extracted from the media server logs in an enterprise network which shows our design significantly improves the quality of media streaming and the system scalability
message passing interface mpi is widely used standard for managing coarse grained concurrency on distributed computers debugging parallel mpi applications however has always been particularly challenging task due to their high degree of concurrent execution and non deterministic behavior deterministic replay is potentially powerful technique for addressing these challenges with existing mpi replay tools adopting either data replay or order replay approaches unfortunately each approach has its tradeoffs data replay generates substantial log sizes by recording every communication message order replay generates small logs but requires all processes to be replayed together we believe that these drawbacks are the primary reasons that inhibit the wide adoption of deterministic replay as the critical enabler of cyclic debugging of mpi applications this paper describes subgroup reproducible replay srr hybrid deterministic replay method that provides the benefits of both data replay and order replay while balancing their trade offs srr divides all processes into disjoint groups it records the contents of messages crossing group boundaries as in data replay but records just message orderings for communication within group as in order replay in this way srr can exploit the communication locality of traffic patterns in mpi applications during replay developers can then replay each group individually srr reduces recording overhead by not recording intra group communication and reduces replay overhead by limiting the size of each replay group exposing these tradeoffs gives the user the necessary control for making deterministic replay practical for mpi applications we have implemented prototype mpiwiz to demonstrate and evaluate srr mpiwiz employs replay framework that allows transparent binary instrumentation of both library and system calls as result mpiwiz replays mpi applications with no source code modification and relinking and handles non determinism in both mpi and os system calls our preliminary results show that mpiwiz can reduce recording overhead by over factor of four relative to data replay yet without requiring the entire application to be replayed as in order replay recording increases execution time by while the application can be replayed in just of its base execution time
the smoke and mirrors file system smfs mirrors files at geographically remote datacenter locations with negligible impact on file system performance at the primary site and minimal degradation as function of link latency it accomplishes this goal using wide area links that run at extremely high speeds but have long round trip time latencies combination of properties that poses problems for traditional mirroring solutions in addition to its raw speed smfs maintains good synchronization should the primary site become completely unavailable the system minimizes loss of work even for applications that simultaneously update groups of files we present the smfs design then evaluate the system on emulab and the cornell national lambda rail nlr ring testbed intended applications include wide area file sharing and remote backup for disaster recovery
we discuss approaches to incrementally construct an ensemble the first constructs an ensemble of classifiers choosing subset from larger set and the second constructs an ensemble of discriminants where classifier is used for some classes only we investigate criteria including accuracy significant improvement diversity correlation and the role of search direction for discriminant ensembles we test subset selection and trees fusion is by voting or by linear model using classifiers on data sets incremental search finds small accurate ensembles in polynomial time the discriminant ensemble uses subset of discriminants and is simpler interpretable and accurate we see that an incremental ensemble has higher accuracy than bagging and random subspace method and it has comparable accuracy to adaboost but fewer classifiers
using automated reasoning techniques we tackle the niche activity of proving that program is free from run time exceptions such property is particularly valuable in high integrity software for example safety or security critical applications the context for our work is the spark approach for the development of high integrity software the spark approach provides significant degree of automation in proving exception freedom where this automation fails however the programmer is burdened with the task of interactively constructing proof and possibly also having to supply auxiliary program annotations we minimize this burden by increasing the automation through an integration of proof planning and program analysis oracle we advocate cooperative integration where proof failure analysis directly constrains the search for auxiliary program annotations the approach has been successfully tested on industrial data
to provide scalable communication infrastructure for systems on chips socs networks on chips nocs communication centric design paradigm is needed to be cost effective socs are often programmable and integrate several different applications or use cases on to the same chip for the soc platform to support the different use cases the noc architecture should satisfy the performance constraints of each individual use case in this work we motivate the need to consider multiple use cases during the noc design process we present method to efficiently map the applications on to the noc architecture satisfying the design constraints of each individual use case we also present novel ways to dynamically reconfigure the network across the different use cases and explore the possibility of integrating dynamic voltage and frequency scaling dvs dfs techniques with the use case centric noc design methodology we validate the performance of the design methodology on several soc applications the dynamic reconfiguration of the noc integrated with dvs dfs schemes results in large power savings for the resulting noc systems
tools and analyses that find bugs in software are becoming increasingly prevalent however even after the potential false alarms raised by such tools are dealt with many real reported errors may go unfixed in such cases the programmers have judged the benefit of fixing the bug to be less than the time cost of understanding and fixing itthe true utility of bug finding tool lies not in the number of bugs it finds but in the number of bugs it causes to be fixedanalyses that find safety policy violations typically give error reports as annotated backtraces or counterexamples we propose that bug reports additionally contain specially constructed patch describing an example way in which the program could be modified to avoid the reported policy violation programmers viewing the analysis output can use such patches as guides starting points or as an additional way of understanding what went wrongwe present an algorithm for automatically constructing such patches given model checking and policy information typically already produced by most such analyses we are not aware of any previous automatic techniques for generating patches in response to safety policy violations our patches can suggest additional code not present in the original program and can thus help to explain bugs related to missing program elements in addition our patches do not introduce any new violations of the given safety policyto evaluate our method we performed software engineering experiment applying our algorithm to over bug reports produced by two off the shelf bug finding tools running on large java programs bug reports also accompanied by patches were three times as likely to be addressed as standard bug reportsthis work represents an early step toward developing new ways to report bugs and to make it easier for programmers to fix them even minor increase in our ability to fix bugs would be great increase for the quality of software
randomized response techniques have been investigated in privacy preserving categorical data analysis however the released distortion parameters can be exploited by attackers to breach privacy in this paper we investigate whether data mining or statistical analysis tasks can still be conducted on randomized data when distortion parameters are not disclosed to data miners we first examine how various objective association measures between two variables may be affected by randomization we then extend to multiple variables by examining the feasibility of hierarchical loglinear modeling finally we show some classic data mining tasks that cannot be applied on the randomized data directly

in this paper we discuss some of our recent research work designing tabletop interfaces for co located photo sharing we draw particular attention to specific feature of an interface design which we have observed over an extensive number of uses as facilitating an under reported but none the less intriguing aspect of the photo sharing experience namely the process of getting sidetracked through series of vignettes of interaction during photo sharing sessions we demonstrate how users of our tabletop photoware system used peripheral presentation of topically incoherent photos to artfully initiate new photo talk sequences in on going discourse from this we draw implications for the design of tabletop photo applications and for the experiential analysis of such devices
the high performance computing domain is enriching with the inclusion of networks on chip nocs as key component of many core cmps or mpsocs architectures nocs face the communication scalability challenge while meeting tight power area and latency constraints designers must address new challenges that were not present before defective components the enhancement of application level parallelism or power aware techniques may break topology regularity thus efficient routing becomes challengein this paper ulbdr universal logic based distributed routing is proposed as an efficient logic based mechanism that adapts to any irregular topology derived from meshes being an alternative to the use of routing tables either at routers or at end nodes ulbdr requires small set of configuration bits thus being more practical than large routing tables implemented in memories several implementations of ulbdr are presented highlighting the trade off between routing cost and coverage the alternatives span from the previously proposed lbdr approach with of coverage to the ulbdr mechanism achieving full coverage this comes with small performance cost thus exhibiting the trade off between fault tolerance and performance
automatic facial expression analysis is an interesting and challenging problem and impacts important applications in many areas such as human computer interaction and data driven animation deriving an effective facial representation from original face images is vital step for successful facial expression recognition in this paper we empirically evaluate facial representation based on statistical local features local binary patterns for person independent facial expression recognition different machine learning methods are systematically examined on several databases extensive experiments illustrate that lbp features are effective and efficient for facial expression recognition we further formulate boosted lbp to extract the most discriminant lbp features and the best recognition performance is obtained by using support vector machine classifiers with boosted lbp features moreover we investigate lbp features for low resolution facial expression recognition which is critical problem but seldom addressed in the existing work we observe in our experiments that lbp features perform stably and robustly over useful range of low resolutions of face images and yield promising performance in compressed low resolution video sequences captured in real world environments

an abstract business process contains description the protocol that business process engages in without revealing the internal computation of the process this description provides the information necessary to compose the process with other web services bpel supports this by providing distinct dialects for specifying abstract and executable processes unfortunately bpel does not prevent complex computations from being included in an abstract process this complicates the protocol description unnecessarily reveals implementation details and makes it difficult to analyze correctness we propose some restrictions on the data manipulation constructs that can be used in an abstract bpel process the restrictions permit full description of protocol while hiding computation restricted abstract process can easily be converted into an abstract bpel process or expanded into an executable bpel process based on these restrictions we propose formal model for business process and use it as the basis of an algorithm for demonstrating the correctness of protocol described by restricted abstract process we then sketch an algorithm for synthesizing protocol based on formal specification of its outcome and the tasks available for its construction
to meet the high demand for powerful embedded processors vliw architectures are increasingly complex eg multiple clusters and moreover they now run increasinglysophisticated control intensive applications as result developingarchitecture specific compiler optimizations is becomingboth increasingly critical and complex while time to market constraints remain very tightin this article we present novel program optimizationapproach called the virtual hardware compiler vhc that can perform as well as static compiler optimizations but which requires far less compiler development effort even for complex vliw architectures and complex targetapplications the principle is to augment the target processorsimulator with superscalar like features observe howthe target program is dynamically optimized during execution and deduce an optimized binary for the static vliwarchitecture developing an architecture specific optimizerthen amounts to modifying the processor simulator whichis very fast compared to adapting static compiler optimizationsto an architecture we also show that vhc optimizedbinary trained on number of data sets performs as wellas statically optimized binary on other test data sets theonly drawback of the approach is largely increased compilationtime which is often acceptable for embedded applicationsand devices using the texas instruments vliwprocessor and the associated compiler we experimentallyshow that this approach performs as well as static compileroptimizations for much lower research and developmenteffort using single core and dual core clusteredc processors we also show that the same approach canbe used for efficiently retargeting binary programs within afamily of processors

fault tolerance is an essential requirement for real time systems due to potentially catastrophic consequences of faults in this paper we investigate an efficient off line scheduling algorithm generating schedules in which real time tasks with precedence constraints can tolerate one processor's permanent failure in heterogeneous system with fully connected network the tasks are assumed to be non preemptable and each task has two copies scheduled on different processors and mutually excluded in time in the literature in recent years the quality of schedule has been previously improved by allowing backup copy to overlap with other backup copies on the same processor however this approach assumes that tasks are independent of one other to meet the needs of real time systems where tasks have precedence constraints new overlapping scheme is proposed we show that given two tasks the necessary conditions for their backup copies to safely overlap in time with each other are their corresponding primary copies are scheduled on two different processors they are independent tasks and the execution of their backup copies implies the failures of the processors on which their primary copies are scheduled for tasks with precedence constraints the new overlapping scheme allows the backup copy of task to overlap with its successors primary copies thereby further reducing schedule length based on proposed reliability model tasks are judiciously allocated to processors so as to maximize the reliability of heterogeneous systems additionally times for detecting and handling of permanent fault are incorporated into the scheduling scheme we have performed experiments using synthetic workloads as well as real world application simulation results show that compared with existing scheduling algorithms in the literature our scheduling algorithm improves reliability by up to with an average of and achieves an improvement in performability measure that combines reliability and schedulability by up to with an average of
network throughput can be increased by allowing multipath adaptive routing adaptive routing allows more freedom in the paths taken by messages spreading load over physical channels more evenly the flexibility of adaptive routing introduces new possibilities of deadlock previous deadlock avoidance schemes in ary cubes require an exponential number of virtual channels independent of network size and dimension planar adaptive routing algorithms reduce the complexity of deadlock prevention by reducing the number of choices at each routing step in the fault free case planar adaptive networks are guaranteed to be deadlock free in the presence of network faults the planar adaptive router can be extended with misrouting to produce working network which remains provably deadlock free and is provably livelock free in addition planar adaptive networks can simultaneously support both in order and adaptive out of order packet delivery planar adaptive routing is of practical significance it provides the simplest known support for deadlock free adaptive routing in ary cubes of more than two dimensions with restricting adaptivity reduces the hardware complexity improving router speed or allowing additional performance enhancing network features the structure of planar adaptive routers is amenable to efficient implementation

multimedia applications are fast becoming one of the dominating workloads for modern computer systems since these applications normally have large data sets and little data reuse many researchers believe that they have poor memory behavior compared to traditional programs and that current cache architectures cannot handle them well it is therefore important to quantitatively characterize the memory behavior of these applications in order to provide insights for future design and research of memory systems however very few results on this topic have been published this paper presents comprehensive research on the memory requirements of group of programs that are representative of multimedia applications these programs include subset of the popular mediabench suite and several large multimedia programs running on the linux windows nt and tru unix operating systems we performed extensive measurement and trace driven simulation experiments we then compared the memory utilization of these programs to that of specint applications we found that multimedia applications actually have better memory behavior than specint programs the high cache hit rates of multimedia applications can be contributed to the following three factors most multimedia applications apply block partitioning algorithms to the input data and work on small blocks of data that easily fit into the cache secondly within these blocks there is significant data reuse as well as spatial locality the third reason is that large number of references generated by multimedia applications are to their internal data structures which are relatively small and can also easily fit into reasonably sized caches
this paper studies how to enable an effective ranked retrieval over data with categorical attributes in particular by supporting personalized ranked retrieval of highly relevant data while ranked retrieval has been actively studied lately existing efforts have focused only on supporting ranking over numerical or text data however many real life data contain large amount of categorical attributes in combination with numerical and text attributes which cannot be efficiently supported unlike numerical attributes where natural ordering is inherent the existence of categorical attributes with no such ordering complicates both the formulation and processing of ranking this paper studies the efficient and effective support of ranking over categorical data as well as uniform support with other types of attributes
global routing for modern large scale circuit designs has attracted much attention in the recent literature most of the state of the art academic global routers just work on simplified routing congestion model that ignores the essential via capacity for routing through multiple metal layers such simplified model would easily cause fatal routability problems in subsequent detailed routing to remedy this deficiency we present in this paper more effective congestion metric that considers both the in tile nets and the residual via capacity for global routing with this congestion metric we develop new global router that features two novel routing algorithms for congestion optimization namely least flexibility first routing and multi source multi sink escaping point routing the least flexibility first routing processes the nets with the least flexibility first facilitating quick prediction of congestion hot spots for the subsequent nets enjoying lower time complexity than traditional maze and search routing in particular the linear time escaping point routing guarantees to find the optimal solution and achieves the theoretical lower bound time complexity experimental results show that our global router can achieve very high quality routing solutions with more reasonable via usage which can benefit and correctly guide subsequent detailed routing
in large scale multimedia storage system lmss where the user requests for different multimedia objects may have different demands placement and replication of the objects is an important factor as it may result in an imbalance in loading across the system since replica management and load balancing is crucial issue in multimedia systems normally this problem is handled by centralized servers eg metadata servers mds in distributed file systems each object based storage device osd responds to the requests coming from the centralized servers independently and has no communication with other osds among the system in this paper we design novel distributed architecture of lmss in which the osds have some kind of intelligences and can cooperate to achieve high performance such an osd named as autonomous object based storage device aosd can replicate the objects to and balance the requests among other aosds and handle fail over and recovery autonomously in the proposed architecture we move the request balancing from centralized mds to aosds and make the system more scalable flexible and robust based on the proposed architecture we propose two different object replication and load balancing algorithms named as minimum average waiting time mawt and one of the best two choices obtc respectively we validate the performance of the algorithms via rigorous simulations with respect to several influencing factors our findings conclusively demonstrate that the proposed architecture minimizes the average waiting time and at the same time carries out load balancing across servers

the semantic web augments the current www by giving information well defined meaning better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation this is done by adding machine understandable content to web resources such added content is called metadata whose semantics is provided by referring to an ontology domain's conceptualization agreed upon by community the semantic web relies on the complex interaction of several technologies involving ontologies therefore sophisticated semantic web applications typically comprise more than one software module instead of coming up with proprietary solutions developers should be able to rely on generic infrastructure for application development in this context we call such an infrastructure application server for the semantic web whose design and development are based on existing application servers however we apply and augment their underlying concepts for use in the semantic web and integrate semantic technology within the server itself the article discusses requirements and design issues of such server presents our implementation kaon server and demonstrates its usefulness by detailed scenario

this paper presents the results of an empirical study on the subjective evaluation of code smells that identify poorly evolvable structures in software we propose use of the term software evolvability to describe the ease of further developing piece of software and outline the research area based on four different viewpoints furthermore we describe the differences between human evaluations and automatic program analysis based on software evolvability metrics the empirical component is based on case study in finnish software product company in which we studied two topics first we looked at the effect of the evaluator when subjectively evaluating the existence of smells in code modules we found that the use of smells for code evaluation purposes can be difficult due to conflicting perceptions of different evaluators however the demographics of the evaluators partly explain the variation second we applied selected source code metrics for identifying four smells and compared these results to the subjective evaluations the metrics based on automatic program analysis and the human based smell evaluations did not fully correlate based upon our results we suggest that organizations should make decisions regarding software evolvability improvement based on combination of subjective evaluations and code metrics due to the limitations of the study we also recognize the need for conducting more refined studies and experiments in the area of software evolvability
we define and study bisimulation for proving contextual equivalence in an aspect extension of the untyped lambda calculus to our knowledge this is the first study of coinductive reasoning principles aimed at proving equality of aspect programs the language we study is very small yet powerful enough to encode mutable references and range of temporal pointcuts including cflow and regular event patterns examples suggest that our bisimulation principle is useful for an encoding of higher order programs with state our methods suffice to establish well known and well studied subtle examples involving higher order functions with stateeven in the presence of first class dynamic advice and expressive pointcuts our reasoning principles show that aspect aware interfaces can aid in ensuring that clients of component are unaffected by changes to an implementation our paper generalizes existing results given for open modules to also include variety of history sensitive pointcuts such as cflow and regular event patternsour formal techniques and results suggest that aspects are amenable to the formal techniques developed for stateful higher order programs

animators today have started using motion captured mocap sequences to drive characters mocap allows rapid acquisition of highly realistic animation data consequently animators have at their disposal an enormous amount of mocap sequences which ironically has created new retrieval problem thus while working with mocap databases an animator often needs to work with subset of useful clips once the animator selects candidate working set of motion clips she then needs to identify appropriate transition points amongst these clips for maximal reusein this paper we describe methods for querying mocap databases and identifying transitions for given set of clips we preprocess clips and clip subsequences and precompute frame locations to allow interactive stitching in contrast with existing methods that view each individual clips as nodes for optimal reuse we reduce the granularity
there has been significant increase in the number of cctv cameras in public and private places worldwide the cost of monitoring these cameras manually and of reviewing recorded video is prohibitive and therefore manual systems tend to be used mainly reactively with only small fraction of the cameras being monitored at any given time there is need to automate at least simple observation tasks through computer vision functionality that has become known popularly as video analytics the large size of cctv systems and the requirement of high detection rates and low false alarms are major challenges this paper illustrates some of the recent efforts reported in the literature highlighting advances and pointing out important limitations
articulated hand tracking systems have been widely used in virtual reality but are rarely deployed in consumer applications due to their price and complexity in this paper we propose an easy to use and inexpensive system that facilitates articulated user input using the hands our approach uses single camera to track hand wearing an ordinary cloth glove that is imprinted with custom pattern the pattern is designed to simplify the pose estimation problem allowing us to employ nearest neighbor approach to track hands at interactive rates we describe several proof of concept applications enabled by our system that we hope will provide foundation for new interactions in modeling animation control and augmented reality
pervasive devices are becoming popular and smaller those mobile systems should be able to adapt to changing requirements and execution environments but it requires the ability to reconfigure deployed codes which is considerably simplified if applications are component oriented rather than monolithic blocks of codes so we propose middleware called wcomp which federates an event driven component oriented approach to compose distributed services for devices this approach is coupled with adaptation mechanisms dealing with separation of concerns in such mechanisms aspects called aspects of assembly are selected either by the user or by self adaptive process and composed by weaver with logical merging of high level specifications the result of the weaver is then projected in terms of pure elementary modifications of components assemblies with respect to blackbox properties of cots components our approach is validated by analyzing the results of different experiments drawn from sets of application configurations randomly generated and by showing its advantages while evaluating the additional costs on the reaction time to context changing
we introduce method for segmentation of materials segmented in volumetric models of mechanical parts created by ray ct scanning for the purpose of generating their boundary surfaces when the volumetric model is composed of two materials one for the object and the other for the background air these boundary surfaces can be extracted as isosurfaces using surface contouring method for volumetric model composed of more than two materials we need to classify the voxel types into segments by material and then use surface contouring method that can deal with both ct values and material types here we propose method for precisely classifying the volumetric model into its component materials using modified and combined method of two well known algorithms in image segmentation region growing and graph cut we then apply our non manifold iso contouring method to generate triangulated mesh surfaces in addition we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by constructing high quality triangular mesh models of the segmented parts
users often want to find entities instead of just documents ie finding documents entirely about specific real world entities rather than general documents where the entities are merely mentioned searching for entities on web scale repositories is still an open challenge as the effectiveness of ranking is usually not satisfactory semantics can be used in this context to improve the results leveraging on entity driven ontologies in this paper we propose three categories of algorithms for query adaptation using semantic information nlp techniques and link structure to rank entities in wikipedia our approaches focus on constructing queries using not only keywords but also additional syntactic information while semantically relaxing the query relying on highly accurate ontology the results show that our approaches perform effectively and that the combination of simple nlp link analysis and semantic techniques improves the retrieval performance of entity search

as fundamental problem in distributed hash table dht based systems load balancing is important to avoid performance degradation and guarantee system fairness among existing migration based load balancing strategies there are two main categories rendezvous directory strategy rds and independent searching strategy iss however none of them can achieve resilience and efficiency at the same time in this paper we propose group multicast strategy gms for load balancing in dht systems which attempts to achieve the benefits of both rds and iss gms does not rely on few static rendezvous directories to perform load balancing instead load information is disseminated within the formed groups via multicast protocol thus each peer has enough information to act as the rendezvous directory and perform load balancing within its group besides intra group load balancing inter group load balancing and emergent load balancing are also supported by gms in gms the position of the rendezvous directory is randomized in each round which further improves system resilience in order to have better understanding of gms we also perform analytical studies on gms in terms of its scalability and efficiency under churn finally the effectiveness of gms is evaluated by extensive simulation under different workload and churn levels

dynamic class loading during program execution in the java programming language is an impediment for generating code that is as efficient as code generated using static whole program analysis and optimization whole program analysis and optimization is possible for languages such as that do not allow new classes and or methods to be loaded during program execution one solution for performing whole program analysis and avoiding incorrect execution after new class is loaded is to invalidate and recompile affected methods runtime invalidation and recompilation mechanisms can be expensive in both space and time and therefore generally restrict optimization to address these drawbacks we propose new framework called the extant analysis framework for interprocedural optimization of programs that support dynamic class or method loading given set of classes comprising the closed world we perform an offline static analysis which partitions references into two categories unconditionally extant references which point only to objects whose runtime type is guaranteed to be in the closed world and conditionally extant references which point to objects whose runtime type is not guaranteed to be in the closed world optimizations solely dependent on the first categorycan be statically performed and are guaranteed to be correct even with any future class method loading optimizations dependent on the second category are guarded by dynamic tests called extant safety tests for correct execution behaviorwe describe the properties for extant safety tests and provide algorithms for their generation and placement

in today's multitiered application architectures clients do not access data stored in the databases directly instead they use applications which in turn invoke the dbms to generate the relevant content since executing application programs may require significant time and other resources it is more advantageous to cache application results in result cache various view materialization and update management techniques have been proposed to deal with updates to the underlying data these techniques guarantee that the cached results are always consistent with the underlying data several applications including commerce sites on the other hand do not require the caches be consistent all the time instead they require that all outdated pages in the caches are invalidated in timely fashion in this paper we show that invalidation is inherently different from view maintenance we develop algorithms that benefit from this difference in reducing the cost of update management in certain applications and we present an invalidation framework that benefits from these algorithms

the order and arrangement of dimensions variates is crucial for the effectiveness of large number of visualization techniques such as parallel coordinates scatterplots recursive pattern and many others in this paper we describe systematic approach to arrange the dimensions according to their similarity the basic idea is to rearrange the data dimensions such that dimensions showing similar behavior are positioned next to each other for the similarity clustering of dimensions we need to define similarity measures which determine the partial or global similarity of dimensions we then consider the problem of finding an optimal one or two dimensional arrangement of the dimensions based on their similarity theoretical considerations show that both the one and the two dimensional arrangement problem are surprisingly hard problems ie they are np complete our solution of the problem is therefore based on heuristic algorithms an empirical evaluation using number of different visualization techniques shows the high impact of our similarity clustering of dimensions on the visualization results
nowadays enormous amounts of data are continuously generated not only in massive scale but also from different sometimes conflicting views therefore it is important to consolidate different concepts for intelligent decision making for example to predict the research areas of some people the best results are usually achieved by combining and consolidating predictions obtained from the publication network co authorship network and the textual content of their publications multiple supervised and unsupervised hypotheses can be drawn from these information sources and negotiating their differences and consolidating decisions usually yields much more accurate model due to the diversity and heterogeneity of these models in this paper we address the problem of consensus learning among competing hypotheses which either rely on outside knowledge supervised learning or internal structure unsupervised clustering we argue that consensus learning is an np hard problem and thus propose to solve it by an efficient heuristic method we construct belief graph to first propagate predictions from supervised models to the unsupervised and then negotiate and reach consensus among them their final decision is further consolidated by calculating each model's weight based on its degree of consistency with other models experiments are conducted on newsgroups data cora research papers dblp author conference network and yahoo movies datasets and the results show that the proposed method improves the classification accuracy and the clustering quality measure nmi over the best base model by up to furthermore it runs in time proportional to the number of instances which is very efficient for large scale data sets

multithreaded programs are prone to errors caused by unintended interference between concurrent threads this paper focuses on verifying that deterministically parallel code is free of such thread interference errors deterministically parallel code may create and use new threads via fork and join and coordinate their behavior with synchronization primitives such as barriers and semaphores such code does not satisfy the traditional non interference property of atomicity or serializability however and so existing atomicity tools are inadequate for checking deterministically parallel code we introduce new non interference specification for deterministically parallel code and we present dynamic analysis to enforce it we also describe singletrack prototype implementation of this analysis singletrack's performance is competitive with prior atomicity checkers but it produces many fewer spurious warnings because it enforces more general non interference property that is applicable to more software

online social media draws heavily on active reader participation such as voting or rating of news stories articles or responses to question this user feedback is invaluable for ranking filtering and retrieving high quality content tasks that are crucial with the explosive amount of social content on the web unfortunately as social media moves into the mainstream and gains in popularity the quality of the user feedback degrades some of this is due to noise but increasingly small fraction of malicious users are trying to game the system by selectively promoting or demoting content for profit or fun hence an effective ranking of social media content must be robust to noise in the user interactions and in particular to vote spam we describe machine learning based ranking framework for social media that integrates user interactions and content relevance and demonstrate its effec tiveness for answer retrieval in popular community question answering portal we consider several vote spam attacks and introduce method of training our ranker to increase its robustness to some common forms of vote spam attacks the results of our large scale experimental evaluation show that our ranker is signifcicantly more robust to vote spam compared to state of the art baseline as well as the ranker not explicitly trained to handle malicious interactions
the star graph interconnection network has been recognized as an attractive alternative to the popular hypercube network in this paper we present multipath based multicast routing model for wormholerouted star graph networks propose two efficient multipath routing schemes and contrast the performance of the proposed schemes with the performance of the scheme presented in our previous work both of the two proposed schemes have been proven to be deadlock free the first scheme simple multipath routing uses multiple independent paths for concurrent multicasting the second scheme two phase multipath routing includes two phases source to relay and relay to destination for each phase multicasting is carried out using simple multipath routing experimental results show that for short and medium messages with small message startup latencies the proposed schemes reduce multicast latency more efficiently than other schemes
we show that there exist translations between polymorphic calculus and subsystem of minimal logic with existential types which form galois insertion embedding the translation from polymorphic calculus into the existential type system is the so called call by name cps translation that can be expounded as an adjoint from the neat connection the construction of an inverse translation is investigated from viewpoint of residuated mappings the duality appears not only in the reduction relations but also in the proof structures such as paths between the source and the target calculi from programming point of view this result means that abstract data types can interpret polymorphic functions under the cps translation we may regard abstract data types as dual notion of polymorphic functions
place names are often used to describe and to enquire about geographical information it is common for users to employ vernacular names that have vague spatial extent and which do not correspond to the official and administrative place name terminology recorded within typical gazetteers there is need therefore to enrich gazetteers with knowledge of such vague places and hence improve the quality of place name based information retrieval here we describe method for modelling vague places using knowledge harvested from web pages it is found that vague place names are frequently accompanied in text by the names of more precise co located places that lie within the extent of the target vague place density surface modelling of the frequency of co occurrence of such names provides an effective method of representing the inherent uncertainty of the extent of the vague place while also enabling approximate crisp boundaries to be derived from contours if required the method is evaluated using both precise and vague places the use of the resulting approximate boundaries is demonstrated using an experimental geographical search engine
this paper outlines the history of the programming language from the early days of its iso standardization through the iso standard to the later stages of the revision of that standard the emphasis is on the ideals constraints programming techniques and people that shaped the language rather than the minutiae of language features among the major themes are the emergence of generic programming and the stl the standard library's algorithms and containers specific topics include separate compilation of templates exception handling and support for embedded systems programming during most of the period covered here was mature language with millions of users consequently this paper discusses various uses of and the technical and commercial pressures that provided the background for its continuing evolution
the analysis of data usage in large set of real traces from high energy physics collaboration revealed the existence of an emergent grouping of files that we coined filecules this paper presents the benefits of using this file grouping for prestaging data and compares it with previously proposed file grouping techniques along range of performance metrics our experiments with real workloads demonstrate that filecule grouping is reliable and useful abstraction for data management in science grids that preserving time locality for data prestaging is highly recommended that job reordering with respect to data availability has significant impact on throughput and finally that relatively short history of traces is good predictor for filecule grouping our experimental results provide lessons for workload modeling and suggest design guidelines for data management in data intensive resource sharing environments

over the last years game theory has provided great insights into the behavior of distributed systems by modeling the players as utility maximizing agents in particular it has been shown that selfishness causes many systems to perform in globally suboptimal fashion such systems are said to have large price of anarchy in this paper we extend this active field of research by allowing some players to be malicious or byzantine rather than selfish we ask what is the impact of byzantine players on the system's efficiency compared to purely selfish environments or compared to the social optimum in particular we introduce the price of malice which captures this efficiency degradation as an example we analyze the price of malice of game which models the containment of the spread of viruses in this game each node can choose whether or not to install anti virus software then virus starts from random node and iteratively infects all neighboring nodes which are not inoculated we establish various results about this game for instance we quantify how much the presence of byzantine players can deteriorate or in case of highly risk averse selfish players improve the social welfare of the distributed system

persistently saturated links are abnormal conditions that indicate bottlenecks in internet traffic network operators are interested in detecting such links for troubleshooting to improve capacity planning and traffic estimation and to detect denial of service attacks currently bottleneck links can be detected either locally through snmp information or remotely through active probing or passive flow based analysis however local snmp information may not be available due to administrative restrictions and existing remote approaches are not used systematically because of their network or computation overhead this paper proposes new approach to remotely detect the presence of bottleneck links using spectral and statistical analysis of traffic our approach is passive operates on aggregate traffic without flow separation and supports remote detection of bottlenecks addressing some of the major limitations of existing approaches our technique assumes that traffic through the bottleneck is dominated by packets with common size typically the maximum transfer unit for reasons discussed in section with this assumption we observe that bottlenecks imprint periodicities on packet transmissions based on the packet size and link bandwidth such periodicities manifest themselves as strong frequencies in the spectral representation of the aggregate traffic observed at downstream monitoring point we propose detection algorithm based on rigorous statistical methods to detect the presence of bottleneck links by examining strong frequencies in aggregate traffic we use data from live internet traces to evaluate the performance of our algorithm under various network conditions results show that with proper parameters our algorithm can provide excellent accuracy up to even if the traffic through the bottleneck link accounts for less than of the aggregate traffic
interaction patterns with handheld mobile devices are constantly evolving researchers observed that users prefer to interact with mobile device using one hand however only few interaction techniques support this mode of operation we show that one handed operations can be enhanced with coordinated interaction using for input the front and back of mobile device which we term as dual surface interaction we present some of the design rationale for introducing coordinated dual surface interactions we demonstrate that several tasks including target selection benefit from dual surface input which allows users to rapidly select small targets in locations that are less accessible when interacting using the thumb with one handed input furthermore we demonstrate the benefits of virtual enhancements that are possible with behind the display relative input to perform complex tasks such as steering our results show that dual surface interactions offer numerous benefits that are not available with input on the front or the back alone

energy consumption can be reduced by scaling down frequency when peak performance is not needed lower frequency permits slower circuits and hence lower supply voltage energy reduc tion comes from voltage reduction technique called dynamic voltage scaling dvs this paper makes the case that the useful frequency range of dvs is limited because there is lower bound on voltage lowering fre quency permits voltage reduction until the lowest voltage is reached beyond that point lowering frequency further does not save energy because voltage is constanthowever there is still opportunity for energy reduction outside the influence of dvs if frequency is lowered enough pairs of pipe line stages can be merged to form shallower pipeline the shal low pipeline has better instructions per cycle ipc than the deep pipeline since energy also depends on ipc energy is reduced for given frequency accordingly we propose dynamic pipeline scaling dps dps enabled deep pipeline can merge adjacent pairs of stages by making the intermediate latches transparent and disabling corresponding feedback paths thus dps enabled pipeline has deep mode for higher frequencies within the influ ence of dvs and shallow mode for lower frequencies shallow mode extends the frequency range for which energy reduction is possible for frequencies outside the influence of dvs dps enabled deep pipeline consumes from to less energy than rigid deep pipeline
the popularity of object oriented programming has led to the wide use of container libraries it is important for the reliability of these containers that they are tested adequately we describe techniques for automated test input generation of java container classes test inputs are sequences of method calls from the container interface the techniques rely on state matching to avoid generation of redundant tests exhaustive techniques use model checking with explicit or symbolic execution to explore all the possible test sequences up to predefined input sizes lossy techniques rely on abstraction mappings to compute and store abstract versions of the concrete states they explore underapproximations of all the possible test sequenceswe have implemented the techniques on top of the java pathfinder model checker and we evaluate them using four java container classes we compare state matching based techniques and random selection for generating test inputs in terms of testing coverage we consider basic block coverage and form of predicate coverage that measures whether all combinations of predetermined set of predicates are covered at each basic block the exhaustive techniques can easily obtain basic block coverage but cannot obtain good predicate coverage before running out of memory on the other hand abstract matching turns out to be powerful approach for generating test inputs to obtain high predicate coverage random selection performed well except on the examples that contained complex input spaces where the lossy abstraction techniques performed better
hashing schemes are common technique to improve the performance in mining not only association rules but also sequential patterns or traversal patterns however the collision problem in hash schemes may result in severe performance degradation in this paper we propose perfect hashing schemes for mining traversal patterns to avoid collisions in the hash table the main idea is to transform each large itemsets into one large itemset by employing delicate encoding scheme then perfect hash schemes designed only for itemsets of length two rather than varied lengths are applied the experimental results show that our method is more than twice as faster than fs algorithm the results also show our method is scalable to database sizes one variant of our perfect hash scheme called partial hash is proposed to cope with the enormous memory space required by typical perfect hash functions we also give comparison of the performances of different perfect hash variants and investigate their properties
recent web searching and mining tools are combining text and link analysis to improve ranking and crawling algorithms the central assumption behind such approaches is that there is correlation between the graph structure of the web and the text and meaning of pages here formalize and empirically evaluate two general conjectures drawing connections from link information to lexical and semantic web content the link content conjecture states that page is similar to the pages that link to it and the link cluster conjecture that pages about the same topic are clustered together these conjectures are often simply assumed to hold and web search tools are built on such assumptions the present quantitative confirmation sheds light on the connection between the success of the latest web mining techniques and the small world topology of the web with encouraging implications for the design of better crawling algorithms
nested transactional memory tm facilitates software composition by letting one module invoke another without either knowing whether the other uses transactions closed nested transactions extend isolation of an inner transaction until the toplevel transaction commits implementations may flatten nested transactions into the top level one resulting in complete abort on conflict or allow partial abort of inner transactions open nested transactions allow committing inner transaction to immediately release isolation which increases parallelism and expressiveness at the cost of both software and hardware complexitythis paper extends the recently proposed flat log based transactional memory logtm with nested transactions flat logtm saves pre transaction values in log detects conflicts with read and write bits per cache block and on abort invokes software handler to unroll the log nested logtm supports nesting by segmenting the log into stack of activation records and modestly replicating bits to facilitate composition with nontransactional code such as language runtime and operating system services we propose escape actions that allow trusted code to run outside the confines of the transactional memory system
the valued constraint satisfaction problem vcsp is generic optimization problem defined by network of local cost functions defined over discrete variables it has applications in artificial intelligence operations research bioinformatics and has been used to tackle optimization problems in other graphical models including discrete markov random fields and bayesian networks the incremental lower bounds produced by local consistency filtering are used for pruning inside branch and bound search in this paper we extend the notion of arc consistency by allowing fractional weights and by allowing several arc consistency operations to be applied simultaneously over the rationals and allowing simultaneous operations we show that an optimal arc consistency closure can theoretically be determined in polynomial time by reduction to linear programming this defines optimal soft arc consistency osac to reach more practical algorithm we show that the existence of sequence of arc consistency operations which increases the lower bound can be detected by establishing arc consistency in classical constraint satisfaction problem csp derived from the original cost function network this leads to new soft arc consistency method called virtual arc consistency which produces improved lower bounds compared with previous techniques and which can solve submodular cost functions these algorithms have been implemented and evaluated on variety of problems including two difficult frequency assignment problems which are solved to optimality for the first time our implementation is available in the open source toulbar platform

flooding based querying and broadcasting schemes have low hop delays of to reach any node that is unit distance away where is the transmission range of any sensor node however in sensor networks with large radio ranges flooding based broadcasting schemes cause many redundant transmissions leading to broadcast storm problem in this paper we study the role of geographic information and state information ie memory of previous messages or transmissions in reducing the redundant transmissions in the network we consider three broadcasting schemes with varying levels of local information where nodes have no geographic or state information ii coarse geographic information about the origin of the broadcast and iii no geographic information but remember previously received messages for each of these network models we demonstrate localized forwarding algorithms for broadcast based on geography or state information that achieve significant reductions in the transmission overheads while maintaining hop delays comparable to flooding based schemes we also consider the related problem of broadcasting to set of spatially uniform points in the network lattice points in the regime where all nodes have only local sense of direction and demonstrate an efficient sparse broadcast scheme based on branching random walk that has low number of packet transmissions thus our results show that even with very little local information it is possible to make broadcast schemes significantly more efficient
hot potato routing is form of synchronous routing which makes no use of buffers at intermediate nodes packets must move at every time step until they reach their destination if contention prevents packet from taking its preferred outgoing edge it is deflected on different edge two simple design principles for hot potato routing algorithms are minimum advance that advances at least one packet towards its destination from every nonempty node and possibly deflects all other packets and maximum advance that advances the maximum possible number of packets livelock is situation in which packets keep moving indefinitely in the network without any packet ever reaching its destination it is known that even maximum advance algorithms might livelock on some networks we show that minimum advance algorithms never livelock on tree networks and that maximum advance algorithms never livelock on triangulated networks
secabstractnak autonomic computing self configuring self healing self managing applications systems and networks is promising solution to ever increasing system complexity and the spiraling costs of human management as systems scale to global proportions most results to date however suggest ways to architect new software designed from the ground up as autonomic systems whereas in the real world organizations continue to use stovepipe legacy systems and or build systems of systems that draw from gamut of disparate technologies from numerous vendors our goal is to retrofit autonomic computing onto such systems externally without any need to understand modify or even recompile the target system's code we present an autonomic infrastructure that operates similarly to active middleware to explicitly add autonomic services to pre existing systems via continual monitoring and feedback loop that performs reconfiguration and or repair as needed our lightweight design and separation of concerns enables easy adoption of individual components for use with variety of target systems independent of the rest of the full infrastructure this work has been validated by several case studies spanning multiple real world application domains
the windows and doorways that connect offices to public spaces are site for people to gather awareness information and initiate interaction however these portals often reveal more information to the public area than the office occupant would like as result people often keep doors and window blinds closed which means that nobody can gather awareness information even those with whom the occupant would be willing to share one solution to this problem is co present media space computer mediated video connection at the boundary between an office and public area these systems can provide both greater privacy control to the occupant and greater overall awareness information to observers to see how co present media spaces would work in real world settings we built what we believe are the first ever co present media spaces and deployed them in two offices from observations gathered over fifteen months it is clear that the systems can do better job of balancing the occupant's need for privacy and the observers need for awareness better than standard window however we also identified number of issues that affected the use and the success of the systems the existence of alternate information sources confusion with existing social norms disparities between effort and need and reduced interactional subtlety for observers in the public area our work contributes both novel arrangement of media space for co present collaborators and the first investigation into the design factors that affect the use and acceptance of these systems
due to the uncertainty of software processes statistic based schedule estimation and stochastic project scheduling both play significant roles in software project management however most current work investigates them independently without an integrated process to achieve on time delivery for software development organisations for such an issue this paper proposes two stage probabilistic scheduling strategy which aims to decrease schedule overruns specifically probability based temporal consistency model is employed at the first pre scheduling stage to support negotiation between customers and project managers for setting balanced deadlines of individual software processes at the second scheduling stage an innovative genetic algorithm based scheduling strategy is proposed to minimise the overall completion time of multiple software processes with individual deadlines the effectiveness of our strategy in achieving on time delivery is verified with large scale simulation experiments

multi label learning deals with the problem where each instance is associated with multiple labels simultaneously the task of this learning paradigm is to predict the label set for each unseen instance through analyzing training instances with known label sets in this paper neural network based multi label learning algorithm named ml rbf is proposed which is derived from the traditional radial basis function rbf methods briefly the first layer of an ml rbf neural network is formed by conducting clustering analysis on instances of each possible class where the centroid of each clustered groups is regarded as the prototype vector of basis function after that second layer weights of the ml rbf neural network are learned by minimizing sum of squares error function specifically information encoded in the prototype vectors corresponding to all classes are fully exploited to optimize the weights corresponding to each specific class experiments on three real world multi label data sets show that ml rbf achieves highly competitive performance to other well established multi label learning algorithms
privacy is an important issue in data publishing many organizations distribute non aggregate personal data for research and they must take steps to ensure that an adversary cannot predict sensitive information pertaining to individuals with high confidence this problem is further complicated by the fact that in addition to the published data the adversary may also have access to other resources eg public records and social networks relating individuals which we call adversarial knowledge robust privacy framework should allow publishing organizations to analyze data privacy by means of not only data dimensions data that publishing organization has but also adversarial knowledge dimensions information not in the data in this paper we first describe general framework for reasoning about privacy in the presence of adversarial knowledge within this framework we propose novel multidimensional approach to quantifying adversarial knowledge this approach allows the publishing organization to investigate privacy threats and enforce privacy requirements in the presence of various types and amounts of adversarial knowledge our main technical contributions include multidimensional privacy criterion that is more intuitive and flexible than previous approaches to modeling background knowledge in addition we identify an important congregation property of the adversarial knowledge dimensions based on this property we provide algorithms for measuring disclosure and sanitizing data that improve computational efficiency several orders of magnitude over the best known techniques
while symmetry reduction has been established to be an important technique for reducing the search space in model checking its application in concurrent software verification is still limited due to the difficulty of specifying symmetry in realistic software we propose an algorithm for automatically discovering and applying transition symmetry in multithreaded programs during dynamic model checking our main idea is using dynamic program analysis to identify permutation of variables and labels of the program that entails syntactic equivalence among the residual code of threads and to check whether the local states of threads are equivalent under the permutation the new transition symmetry discovery algorithm can bring substantial state space savings during dynamic verification of concurrent programs we have implemented the new algorithm in the dynamic model checker inspect our preliminary experiments show that this algorithm can successfully discover transition symmetries that are hard or otherwise cumbersome to identify manually and can significantly reduce the model checking time while using inspect to examine realistic multithreaded applications

this paper evaluates managing the processor's datapath width at the compiler level by means of exploiting dynamic narrow width operands we capitalize on the large occurrence of these operands in multimedia programs to build static narrow width regions that may be directly exposed to the compiler we propose to augment the isa with instructions directly exposing the datapath and the register widths to the compiler simple exception management allows this exposition to be only speculative in this way we permit the software to speculatively accommodate the execution of program on narrower datapath width in order to save energy for this purpose we introduce novel register file organization the byte slice register file which allows the width of the register file to be dynamically reconfigured providing both static and dynamic energy savings we show that by combining the advantages of the byte slice register file with the advantages provided by clock gating the datapath on per region basis up to of the datapath dynamic energy can be saved while reduction of the register file static energy is achieved

the mpi programming model hides network type and topology from developers but also allows them to seamlessly distribute computational job across multiple cores in both an intra and inter node fashion this provides for high locality performance when the cores are either on the same node or on nodes closely connected by the same network type the streaming model splits computational job into linear chain of decoupled units this decoupling allows the placement of job units on optimal nodes according to network topology furthermore the links between these units can be of varying protocols when the application is distributed across heterogeneous network in this paper we study how to integrate the mpi and stream programming models in order to exploit network locality and topology we present hybrid mpi stream framework that aims to take advantage of each model's strengths we test our framework with financial application this application simulates an electronic market for single financial instrument stream of buy and sell orders is fed into price matching engine the matching engine creates stream of order confirmations trade confirmations and quotes based on its attempts to match buyers with sellers our results show that the hybrid mpi stream framework can deliver performance improvement at certain order transmission rates
information extraction ie is the task of extracting knowledge from unstructured text we present novel unsupervised approach for information extraction based on graph mutual reinforcement the proposed approach does not require any seed patterns or examples instead it depends on redundancy in large data sets and graph based mutual reinforcement to induce generalized extraction patterns the proposed approach has been used to acquire extraction patterns for the ace automatic content extraction relation detection and characterization rdc task ace rdc is considered hard task in information extraction due to the absence of large amounts of training data and inconsistencies in the available data the proposed approach achieves superior performance which could be compared to supervised techniques with reasonable training data
constraints on the memory size of embedded systems require reducing the image size of executing programs common techniques include code compression and reduced instruction sets we propose novel technique that eliminates large portions of the executable image without compromising execution time due to decompression or code generation due to reduced instruction sets frozen code and data portions are identified using profiling techniques and removed from the loadable image they are replaced with branches to code stubs that load them in the unlikely case that they are accessed the executable is sustained in runnable modeanalysis of the frozen portions reveals that most are error and uncommon input handlers only minority of the code less than that was identified as frozen during training run is also accessed with production datasetsthe technique was applied on three benchmark suites spec cint spec cfp and mediabench and results in image size reductions of up to and per suite the average reductions are and per suite

citations to publication venues in the form of journal conference and workshop contain spelling variants acronyms abbreviated forms and misspellings all of which make more difficult to retrieve the item of interest the task of discovering and reconciling these variant forms of bibliographic references is known as authority work the key goal is to create the so called authority files which maintain for any given bibliographic item list of variant labels ie variant strings used as reference to it in this paper we propose to use information available on the web to create high quality publication venue authority files our idea is to recognize and extract references to publication venues in the text snippets of the answers returned by search engine references to same publication venue are then reconciled in an authority file each entry in this file is composed of canonical name for the venue an acronym the venue type ie journal conference or workshop and mapping to various forms of writing its name in bibliographic citations experimental results show that our web based method for creating authority files is superior to previous work based on straight string matching techniques considering the average precision in finding correct venue canonical names we observe gains up to
in this paper we present new program analysis method which we call storage use analysis this analysis deduces how objects are used by the program and allows the optimization of their allocation this analysis can be applied to both statically typed languages eg ml and latently typed languages eg scheme it handles side effects higher order functions separate compilation and does not require cps transformation we show the application of our analysis to two important optimizations stack allocation and unboxing the first optimization replaces some heap allocations by stack allocations for user and system data storage eg lists vectors procedures the second optimization avoids boxing some objects this analysis and associated optimitations have been implemented in the bigloo scheme ml compiler experimental results show that for many allocation intensive programs we get significant speedup in particular numerically intensive programs are almost times faster because floating point numbers are unboxed and no longer heap allocated
extensive research efforts have been devoted to implement group of type safe mutually recursive classes recently proposals for separating each member of the group as reusable and composable programming unit have also been presented one problem of these proposals is verbosity of the source programs we have to declare recursive type parameter to parameterize each mutually recursive class within each class declaration and we have to declare fixed point class with empty class body for each parameterized class therefore even though the underlying type system is simple programs written in these languages tend to be rather complex and hard to understand in this paper we propose language with lightweight dependent classes that forms simple type system built on top of generic java in this language we can implement each member of type safe mutually recursive classes in separate source file without writing lot of complex boilerplate code to carefully investigate type soundness of our proposal we develop xfgj simple extension of fgj supporting lightweight dependent classes this type system is proved to be sound
as data streams are gaining prominence in growing number of emerging application domains classification on data streams is becoming an active research area currently the typical approach to this problem is based on ensemble learning which learns basic classifiers from training data stream and forms the global predictor by organizing these basic ones while this approach seems successful to some extent its performance usually suffers from two contradictory elements existing naturally within many application scenarios firstly the need for gathering sufficient training data for basic classifiers and engaging enough basic learners in voting for bias variance reduction and secondly the requirement for significant sensitivity to concept drifts which places emphasis on using recent training data and up to date individual classifiers it results in such dilemma that some algorithms are not sensitive enough to concept drifts while others although sensitive enough suffer from unsatisfactory classification accuracy in this paper we propose an ensemble learning algorithm which furnishes training data for basic classifiers starting from the up to date data chunk and searching for complement from past chunks while ruling out the data inconsistent with current concept provides effective voting by adaptively distinguishing sensible classifiers from the else and engaging sensible ones as voters experimental results justify the superiority of this strategy in terms of both accuracy and sensitivity especially in severe circumstances where training data is extremely insufficient or concepts are evolving frequently and significantly
this paper presents the design implementation and performance evaluation of suite of resource policing mechanisms that allow guest processes to efficiently and unobtrusively exploit otherwise idle workstation resources unlike traditional policies that harvest cycles only from unused machines we employ fine grained cycle stealing to exploit resources even from machines that have active users we developed suite of kernel extensions that enable these policies to operate without significantly impacting host processes new starvation level cpu priority for guest jobs new page replacement policy that imposes hard bounds on physical memory usage by guest processes and new scheduling mechanism called rate windows that throttle guest processes usage of and network bandwidth we evaluate both the individual impacts of each mechanism and their utility for our fine grain cycle stealing
the reconfigurable devices such as cpld and fpga become more popular for its great potential on accelerating applications they are widely used as an application specified hardware accelerator many run time reconfigurable platforms are introduced such as the intel quickassist technology however it's time consuming to design hardware accelerator while the performance is hard to determine because of the extra overheads it involved in order to estimate the efficiency of the accelerator theoretical analysis of such platforms was done in our paper three factors which impact the performance of the accelerator were concluded as well speed up ratio reconfiguration overhead and communication overhead furthermore performance model was established and an experiment on bzip was done to verify the model the results showed that the model's estimation is very close to the real world and the average error on the efficiency's threshold is less than
software engineer can use meaning preserving program restructuring tool during maintenance to change program's structure to ease modification one common restructuring action is to create new abstract data type by encapsulating an existing data structure data encapsulation simplifies modification by isolating changes to the implementation and behavior of an abstract data type to perform encapsulation programmer must understand how the data structure is used in the code identify abstract operations performed on the data structure and choose concrete expressions to be made into functions we provide manipulable program visualization called the star diagram that both highlights information partinent to encapsulation and supports the application of meaning preserving restructuring transformations on the program through direct manipulation user interface the visualization graphically and compactly presents all statements in the program that use the given global data structure helping the programmer to choose the functions that completely encapsulate it additionally the visualization elides code unrelated to the data structure and to the task and collapses similar expressions to allow the programmer to identify frequently occurring code fragments and manipulate them together the visualization is mapped directly to the program text so manipulation of the visualization also restructures the program we describe the design implementation and application of the star diagram and evaluate its ability to assist data encapsulation in large programs
in this paper we address stereo matching in the presence of class of non lambertian effects where image formation can be modeled as the additive superposition of layers at different depths the presence of such effects makes it impossible for traditional stereo vision algorithms to recover depths using direct color matching based methods we develop several techniques to estimate both depths and colors of the component layers depth hypotheses are enumerated in pairs one from each layer in nested plane sweep for each pair of depth hypotheses matching is accomplished using spatial temporal differencing we then use graph cut optimization to solve for the depths of both layers this is followed by an iterative color update algorithm which we proved to be convergent our algorithm recovers depth and color estimates for both synthetic and real image sequences
this research investigates ways of predicting which files would be most likely to contain large numbers of faults in the next release of large industrial software system previous work involved making predictions using several different models ranging from simple fully automatable model the loc model to several different variants of negative binomial regression model that were customized for the particular software system under study not surprisingly the custom models invariably predicted faults more accurately than the simple model however development of customized models requires substantial time and analytic effort as well as statistical expertise we now introduce new more sophisticated models that yield more accurate predictions than the earlier loc model but which nonetheless can be fully automated we also extend our earlier research by presenting another large scale empirical study of the value of these prediction models using new industrial software system over nine year period

per core local scratchpad memories allow direct inter core communication with latency and energy advantages over coherent cache based communication especially as cmp architectures become more distributed we have designed cache integrated network interfaces nis appropriate for scalable multicores that combine the best of two worlds the flexibility of caches and the efficiency of scratchpad memories on chip sram is configurably shared among caching scratchpad and virtualized ni functions this paper presents our architecture which provides local and remote scratchpad access to either individual words or multi word blocks through rdma copy furthermore we introduce event responses as mechanism for software configurable synchronization primitives we present three event response mechanisms that expose ni functionality to software for multiword transfer initiation memory barriers for explicitly selected accesses of arbitrary size and multi party synchronization queues we implemented these mechanisms in four core fpga prototype and evaluated the on chip communication performance on the prototype as well as on cmp simulator with up to cores we demonstrate efficient synchronization low overhead communication and amortized overhead bulk transfers which allow parallelization gains for fine grain tasks and efficient exploitation of the hardware bandwidth
query expansion of named entities can be employed in order to increase the retrieval effectiveness peculiarity of named entities compared to other vocabulary terms is that they are very dynamic in appearance and synonym relationships between terms change with time in this paper we present an approach to extracting synonyms of named entities over time from the whole history of wikipedia in addition we will use their temporal patterns as feature in ranking and classifying them into two types ie time independent or time dependent time independent synonyms are invariant to time while time dependent synonyms are relevant to particular time period ie the synonym relationships change over time further we describe how to make use of both types of synonyms to increase the retrieval effectiveness ie query expansion with time independent synonyms for an ordinary search and query expansion with time dependent synonyms for search wrt temporal criteria finally through an evaluation based on trec collections we demonstrate how retrieval performance of queries consisting of named entities can be improved using our approach
load instructions diminish processor performance in two ways first due to the continuously widening gap between cpu and memory speed the relative latency of load instructions grows constantly and already slows program execution second memory reads limit the available instruction level parallelism because instructions that use the result of load must wait for the memory access to complete before they can start executing load value predictors alleviate both problems by allowing the cpu to speculatively continue processing without having to wait for load instructions which can significantly improve the execution speed while several hybrid load value predictors have been proposed and found to work well no systematic study of such predictors exists in this paper we investigate the performance of all hybrids that can be built out of register value last value stride delta last four value and finite context method predictor our analysis shows that hybrids can deliver percent more speedup than the best single component predictors an examination of the individual components of hybrids revealed that predictors with poor standalone performance sometimes make excellent components in hybrid while combining well performing individual predictors often does not result in an effective hybrid our hybridization study identified the register value stride delta predictor as one of the best two component hybrids it matches or exceeds the speedup of two component hybrids from the literature in spite of its substantially smaller and simpler design of all the predictors we studied the register value stride delta last four value hybrid performs best it yields harmonic mean speedup over the eight specint programs of percent

reputation systems have been popular in estimating the trustworthiness and predicting the future behavior of nodes in large scale distributed system where nodes may transact with one another without prior knowledge or experience one of the fundamental challenges in distributed reputation management is to understand vulnerabilities and develop mechanisms that can minimize the potential damages to system by malicious nodes in this paper we identify three vulnerabilities that are detrimental to decentralized reputation management and propose trustguard safeguard framework for providing highly dependable and yet efficient reputation system first we provide dependable trust model and set of formal methods to handle strategic malicious nodes that continuously change their behavior to gain unfair advantages in the system second transaction based reputation system must cope with the vulnerability that malicious nodes may misuse the system by flooding feedbacks with fake transactions third but not least we identify the importance of filtering out dishonest feedbacks when computing reputation based trust of node including the feedbacks filed by malicious nodes through collusion our experiments show that comparing with existing reputation systems our framework is highly dependable and effective in countering malicious nodes regarding strategic oscillating behavior flooding malevolent feedbacks with fake transactions and dishonest feedbacks
question classification is an important step in factual question answering qa and other dialog systems several attempts have been made to apply statistical machine learning approaches including support vector machines svms with sophisticated features and kernels curiously the payoff beyond simple bag of words representation has been small we show that most questions reveal their class through short contiguous token subsequence which we call its informer span perfect knowledge of informer spans can enhance accuracy from to using linear svms on standard benchmarks in contrast standard heuristics based on shallow pattern matching give only improvement showing that the notion of an informer is non trivial using novel multi resolution encoding of the question's parse tree we induce conditional random field crf to identify informer spans with about accuracy then we build meta classifier using linear svm on the crf output enhancing accuracy to which is better than all published numbers
content filtering based intrusion detection systems have been widely deployed in enterprise networks and have become standard measure to protect networks and network users from cyber attacks although several solutions have been proposed recently finding an efficient solution is considered as difficult problem due to the limitations in resources such as small memory size as well as the growing link speed in this paper we present novel content filtering technique called table driven bottom up tree tbt which was designed to fully exploit hardware parallelism to achieve real time packet inspection ii to require small memory for storing signatures iii to be flexible in modifying the signature database and iv to support complex signature representation such as regular expressions we configured tbt considering the hardware specifications and limitations and implemented it using fpga simulation based performance evaluations showed that the proposed technique used only kilobytes of memory for storing the latest version of snort rule consisting of signatures in addition unlike many other hardware based solutions modification to signature database does not require hardware re compilation in tbt
the goal of this article is to review the state of the art tracking methods classify them into different categories and identify new trends object tracking in general is challenging problem difficulties in tracking objects can arise due to abrupt object motion changing appearance patterns of both the object and the scene nonrigid object structures object to object and object to scene occlusions and camera motion tracking is usually performed in the context of higher level applications that require the location and or shape of the object in every frame typically assumptions are made to constrain the tracking problem in the context of particular application in this survey we categorize the tracking methods on the basis of the object and motion representations used provide detailed descriptions of representative methods in each category and examine their pros and cons moreover we discuss the important issues related to tracking including the use of appropriate image features selection of motion models and detection of objects
ensuring model quality is key success factor in many computer science areas and becomes crucial in recent software engineering paradigms like the one proposed by model driven software development tool support for measurements and redesigns becomes essential to help developers improve the quality of their models however developing such helper tools for the wide variety of frequently domain specific visual notations used by software engineers is hard and repetitive task that does not take advantage from previous developments thus being frequently forgotten in this paper we present our approach for the visual specification of measurements and redesigns for domain specific visual languages dsvls with this purpose we introduce novel dsvl called slammer that contains generalisations of some of the more used types of internal product measurements and redesigns the goal is to facilitate the task of defining measurements and redesigns for any dsvl as well as the generation of tools from such specification reducing or eliminating the necessity of coding we rely on the use of visual patterns for the specification of the relevant elements for each measurement and redesign type in addition slammer allows the specification of redesigns either procedurally or by means of graph transformation rules these redesigns can be triggered when the measurements reach certain threshold these concepts have been implemented in the meta modelling tool atom in this way when dsvl is designed it is possible to specify measurements and redesigns that will become available in the final modelling environment generated for the language as an example we show case study in the web modelling domain
low latency anonymity systems are susceptive to traffic analysis attacks in this paper we propose dependent link padding scheme to protect anonymity systems from traffic analysis attacks while providing strict delay bound the covering traffic generated by our scheme uses the minimum sending rate to provide full anonymity for given set of flows the relationship between user anonymity and the minimum covering traffic rate is then studied via analysis and simulation when user flows are poisson processes with the same sending rate the minimum covering traffic rate to provide full anonymity to users is log for pareto traffic we show that the rate of the covering traffic converges to constant when the number of flows goes to infinity finally we use real internet trace files to study the behavior of our algorithm when user flows have different rates
virtual machine monitors vmms have been hailed as the basis for an increasing number of reliable or trusted computing systems the xen vmm is relatively small piece of software hypervisor that runs at lower level than conventional operating system in order to provide isolation between virtual machines its size is offered as an argument for its trustworthiness however the management of xen based system requires privileged full blown operating system to be included in the trusted computing base tcb in this paper we introduce our work to disaggregate the management virtual machine in xen based system we begin by analysing the xen architecture and explaining why the status quo results in large tcb we then describe our implementation which moves the domain builder the most important privileged component into minimal trusted compartment we illustrate how this approach may be used to implement trusted virtualisation and improve the security of virtual tpm implementations finally we evaluate our approach in terms of the reduction in tcb size and by performing security analysis of the disaggregated system
java is high productivity object oriented programming language that is rapidly gaining popularity in high performance application development one major obstacle to its broad acceptance is its mediocre performance when compared with fortran or especially if the developers use object oriented features of the language extensively previous work in improving the performance of object oriented high performance scientific java applications consisted of high level compiler optimization and analysis strategies such as class specialization and object inlining this paper extends prior work on object inlining by improving the analysis and developing new code transformation techniques to further improve the performance of high performance applications written in high productivity object oriented style two major impediments to effective object inlining are object and array aliasing and binary method invocations this paper implements object and array alias strategies to address the aliasing problem while utilizing an idea from telescoping languages to address the binary method invocation problem application runtime gains of up to result from employing these techniques these improvements should further increase the scientific community's acceptance of the java programming language in the development of high performance high productivity scientific applications
as part of an architectural modeling project this paper investigates the problem of understanding and manipulating images of buildings our primary motivation is to automatically detect and seamlessly remove unwanted foreground elements from urban scenes without explicit handling these objects will appear pasted as artifacts on the model recovering the building facade in video sequence is relatively simple because parallax induces foreground background depth layers but here we consider static images only we develop series of methods that enable foreground removal from images of buildings or brick walls the key insight is to use priori knowledge about grid patterns on building facades that can be modeled as near regular textures nrt we describe markov random field mrf model for such textures and introduce markov chain monte carlo mcmc optimization procedure for discovering them this simple spatial rule is then used as starting point for inference of missing windows facade segmentation outlier identification and foreground removal
large scientific parallel applications demand large amounts of memory space current parallel computing platforms schedule jobs without fully knowing their memory requirements this leads to uneven memory allocation in which some nodes are overloaded this in turn leads to disk paging which is extremely expensive in the context of scientific parallel computing to solve this problem we propose new peer to peer solution called parallel network ram this approach avoids the use of disk better utilizes available ram resources and will allow larger problems to be solved while reducing the computational communication and synchronization overhead typically involved in parallel applications we proposed several different parallel network ram designs and evaluated the performance of each under different conditions we discovered that different designs are appropriate in different situations
we show the practical feasibility of monitoring complex security properties using runtime monitoring approach for metric first order temporal logic in particular we show how wide variety of security policies can be naturally formalized in this expressive logic ranging from traditional policies like chinese wall and separation of duty to more specialized usage control and compliance requirements we also explain how these formalizations can be directly used for monitoring and experimentally evaluate the performance of the resulting monitors
the continuing trend toward greater processing power larger storage and in particular increased display surface by using multiple monitor supports increased multi tasking by the computer user the concomitant increase in desktop complexity has the potential to push the overhead of window management to frustrating and counterproductive new levels it is difficult to adequately design for multiple monitor systems without understanding how multiple monitor users differ from or are similar to single monitor users therefore we deployed tool to group of single monitor and multiple monitor users to log window management activity analysis of the data collected from this tool revealed that usage of interaction components may change with an increase in number of monitors and window visibility can be useful measure of user display space management activity especially for multiple monitor users the results from this analysis begin to fill gap in research about real world window management practices
graph data are subject to uncertainties in many applications due to incompleteness and imprecision of data mining uncertain graph data is semantically different from and computationally more challenging than mining exact graph data this paper investigates the problem of mining frequent subgraph patterns from uncertain graph data the frequent subgraph pattern mining problem is formalized by designing new measure called expected support an approximate mining algorithm is proposed to find an approximate set of frequent subgraph patterns by allowing an error tolerance on the expected supports of the discovered subgraph patterns the algorithm uses an efficient approximation algorithm to determine whether subgraph pattern can be output or not the analytical and experimental results show that the algorithm is very efficient accurate and scalable for large uncertain graph databases
hierarchical multi label classification hmc is variant of classification where instances may belong to multiple classes at the same time and these classes are organized in hierarchy this article presents several approaches to the induction of decision trees for hmc as well as an empirical study of their use in functional genomics we compare learning single hmc tree which makes predictions for all classes together to two approaches that learn set of regular classification trees one for each class the first approach defines an independent single label classification task for each class sc obviously the hierarchy introduces dependencies between the classes while they are ignored by the first approach they are exploited by the second approach named hierarchical single label classification hsc depending on the application at hand the hierarchy of classes can be such that each class has at most one parent tree structure or such that classes may have multiple parents dag structure the latter case has not been considered before and we show how the hmc and hsc approaches can be modified to support this setting we compare the three approaches on yeast data sets using as classification schemes mips's funcat tree structure and the gene ontology dag structure we show that hmc trees outperform hsc and sc trees along three dimensions predictive accuracy model size and induction time we conclude that hmc trees should definitely be considered in hmc tasks where interpretable models are desired
time dependant models have been intensively studied for many reasons among others because of their applications in software verification and due to the development of embedded platforms where reliability and safety depend to large extent on the time features many of the time dependant models were suggested as real time extensions of several well known untimed models the most studied formalisms include networks of timed automata which extend the model of communicating finite state machines with finite number of real valued clocks and timed extensions of petri nets where the added time constructs include eg time intervals that are assigned to the transitions time petri nets or to the arcs timed arc petri nets in this paper we shall semi formally introduce these models discuss their strengths and weaknesses and provide an overview of the known results about the relationships among the models
spline joints are novel class of joints that can model general scleronomic constraints for multibody dynamics based on the minimal coordinates formulation the main idea is to introduce spline curves and surfaces in the modeling of joints we model dof joints using splines on se and construct multi dof joints as the product of exponentials of splines in euclidean space we present efficient recursive algorithms to compute the derivatives of the spline joint as well as geometric algorithms to determine optimal parameters in order to achieve the desired joint motion our spline joints can be used to create interesting new simulated mechanisms for computer animation and they can more accurately model complex biomechanical joints such as the knee and shoulder
the iceberg cube mining computes all cells corresponding to group by partitions that satisfy given constraint on aggregated behaviors of the tuples in group by partition the number of cells often is so large that the result cannot be realistically searched without pushing the constraint into the search previous works have pushed antimonotone and monotone constraints however many useful constraints are neither antimonotone nor monotone we consider general class of aggregate constraints of the form theta sigma where is an arithmetic function of sql like aggregates and theta is one of we propose novel pushing technique called divide and approximate to push such constraints the idea is to recursively divide the search space and approximate the given constraint using antimonotone or monotone constraints in subspaces this technique applies to class called separable constraints which properly contains all constraints built by an arithmetic function of all sql aggregates
finite state verification eg model checking provides powerful means to detect errors that are often subtle and difficult to reproduce nevertheless the transition of this technology from research to practice has been slow while there are number of potential causes for reluctance in adopting such formal methods in practice we believe that primary cause rests with the fact that practitioners are unfamiliar with specification processes notations and strategies recent years have seen growing success in leveraging experience with design and coding patterns we propose pattern based approach to the presentation codification and reuse of property specifications for finite state verification

devices are increasingly vulnerable to soft errors as their feature sizes shrink previously soft error rates were significant primarily in space and high atmospheric computing modern architectures now use features so small at sufficiently low voltages that soft errors are becoming important even at terrestrial altitudes due to their large number of components supercomputers are particularly susceptible to soft errors since many large scale parallel scientific applications use iterative linear algebra methods the soft error vulnerability of these methods constitutes large fraction of the applications overall vulnerability many users consider these methods invulnerable to most soft errors since they converge from an imprecise solution to precise one however we show in this paper that iterative methods are vulnerable to soft errors exhibiting both silent data corruptions and poor ability to detect errors further we evaluate variety of soft error detection and tolerance techniques including checkpointing linear matrix encodings and residual tracking techniques

we present technique for implementing visual language compilers through standard compiler generation platforms the technique exploits extended positional grammars xpgs for short for modeling the visual languages in natural way and uses set of mapping rules to translate an xpg specification into translation schema this lets us generate visual language parsers through standard compiler compiler techniques and tools like yacc the generated parser accepts exactly the same set of visual sentences derivable through the application of xpg productions the technique represents an important achievement since it enables us to perform visual language compiler construction through standard compiler compilers rather than specific compiler generation tools this makes our approach particularly appealing since compiler compilers are widely used and rely on well founded theory moreover the approach provides the basis for the unification of traditional textual language technologies and visual language compiler technologies
program analysis is the heart of modern compilers most control flow analyses are reduced to the problem of finding fixed point in certain transition system and such fixed point is commonly computed through an iterative procedure that repeats tracing until convergencethis paper proposes new method to analyze programs through recursive graph traversals instead of iterative procedures based on the fact that most programs without spaghetti goto have well structured control flow graphs graphs with bounded tree width our main techniques are an algebraic construction of control flow graph called sp term which enables control flow analysis to be defined in natural recursive form and the optimization theorem which enables us to compute optimal solution by dynamic programmingwe illustrate our method with two examples dead code detection and register allocation different from the traditional standard iterative solution our dead code detection is described as simple combination of bottom up and top down traversals on sp term register allocation is more interesting as it further requires optimality of the result we show how the optimization theorem on sp terms works to find an optimal register allocation as certain dynamic programming
data dominated signal processing applications are typically described using large and multi dimensional arrays and loop nests the order of production and consumption of array elements in these loop nests has huge impact on the amount of memory required during execution this is essential since the size and complexity of the memory hierarchy is the dominating factor for power performance and chip size in these applications this paper presents number of guiding principles for the ordering of the dimensions in the loop nests they enable the designer or design tools to find the optimal ordering of loop nest dimensions for individual data dependencies in the code we prove the validity of the guiding principles when no prior restrictions are given regarding fixation of dimensions if some dimensions are already fixed at given nest levels this is taken into account when fixing the remaining dimensions in most cases an optimal ordering is found for this situation as well the guiding principles can be used in the early design phases in order to enable minimization of the memory requirement through in place mapping we use real life examples to show how they can be applied to reach cost optimized end product the results show orders of magnitude improvement in memory requirement compared to using the declared array sizes and similar penalties for choosing the suboptimal ordering of loops when in place mapping is exploited

the emergence of location aware services calls for new real time spatio temporal query processing algorithms that deal with large numbers of mobile objects and queries online query response is an important characterization of location aware services delay in the answer to query gives invalid and obsolete results simply because moving objects can change their locations before the query responds to handle large numbers of spatio temporal queries efficiently we propose the idea of sharing as means to achieve scalability in this paper we introduce several types of sharing in the context of continuous spatio temporal queries examples of sharing in the context of real time spatio temporal database systems include sharing the execution sharing the underlying space sharing the sliding time windows and sharing the objects of interest we demonstrate how sharing can be integrated into query predicates eg selection and spatial join processing the goal of this paper is to outline research directions and approaches that will lead to scalable and efficient location aware services

the integration of knowledge from multiple sources is an important aspect in several areas such as data warehousing database integration automated reasoning systems active reactive databases and others thus central topic in databases is the construction of integration systems designed for retrieving and querying uniform data stored in multiple information sources this chapter illustrates recent techniques for computing repairs as well as consistent answers over inconsistent databases often databases may be inconsistent with respect to set of integrity constraints that is one or more integrity constraints are not satisfied most of the techniques for computing repairs and queries over inconsistent databases work for restricted cases and only recently there have been proposals to consider more general constraints in this chapter we give an informal description of the main techniques proposed in the literature
although graphical user interfaces guis constitute large part of the software being developed today and are typically created using rapid prototyping there are no effective regression testing techniques for guis the needs of gui regression testing differ from those of traditional software when the structure of gui is modified test cases from the original gui are either reusable or unusable on the modified gui since gui test case generation is expensive our goal is to make the unusable test cases usable the idea of reusing these unusable aka obsolete test cases has not been explored before in this paper we show that for guis the unusability of large number of test cases is serious problem we present novel gui regression testing technique that first automatically determines the usable and unusable test cases from test suite after gui modification it then determines which of the unusable test cases can be repaired so they can execute on the modified gui the last step is to repair the test cases our technique is integrated into gui testing framework that given test case automatically executes it on the gui we implemented our regression testing technique and demonstrate for two case studies that our approach is effective in that many of the test cases can be repaired and is practical in terms of its time performance
existing methods for white balancing photographs tend to rely on skilled interaction from the user which is prohibitive for most amateur photographers we propose minimal interaction system for white balancing photographs that contain humans many of the pictures taken by amateur photographers fall into this category our system matches user selected patch of skin in photograph to an entry in skin reflectance function database the estimate of the illuminant that emerges from the skin matching can be used to white balance the photograph allowing users to compensate for biased illumination in an image with single click we compare the quality of our results to output from three other low interaction methods including commercial approaches such as google picasa's one click relighting whitepoint based algorithm and ebner's localized gray world algorithm the comparisons indicate that our approach offers several advantages for amateur photographers
most prolog implementations are implemented in low level languages such as and are based on variation of the wam instruction set which enhances their performance but makes them hard to write in addition many of the more dynamic features of prolog like assert despite their popularity are not well supported we present high level continuation based prolog interpreter based on the pypy project the pypy project makes it possible to easily and efficiently implement dynamic languages it provides tools that automatically generate just in time compiler for given interpreter of the target language by using partial evaluation techniques the resulting prolog implementation is surprisingly efficient it clearly outperforms existing interpreters of prolog in high level languages such as java moreover on some benchmarks our system outperforms state of the art wam based prolog implementations our paper aims to show that declarative languages such as prolog can indeed benefit from having just in time compiler and that pypy can form the basis for implementing programming languages other than python
abstract prefetching is an important technique to reduce the average web access latency existing prefetching methods are based mostly on url graphs they use the graphical nature of http links to determine the possible paths through hypertext system although the url graph based approaches are effective in prefetching of frequently accessed documents few of them can prefetch those urls that are rarely visited this paper presents keyword based semantic prefetching approach to overcome the limitation it predicts future requests based on semantic preferences of past retrieved web documents we apply this technique to internet news services and implement client side personalized prefetching system newsagent the system exploits semantic preferences by analyzing keywords in url anchor text of previously accessed documents in different news categories it employs neural network model over the keyword set to predict future requests the system features self learning capability and good adaptability to the change of client surfing interest newsagent does not exploit keyword synonymy for conservativeness in prefetching however it alleviates the impact of keyword polysemy by taking into account server provided categorical information in decision making and hence captures more semantic knowledge than term document literal matching methods experimental results from daily browsing of abc news cnn and msnbc news sites for period of three months show an achievement of up to percent hit ratio due to prefetching
this paper studies the problem of pruning an ensemble of classifiers from reinforcement learning perspective it contributes new pruning approach that uses the learning algorithm in order to approximate an optimal policy of choosing whether to include or exclude each classifier from the ensemble extensive experimental comparisons of the proposed approach against state of the art pruning and combination methods show very promising results additionally we present an extension that allows the improvement of the solutions returned by the proposed approach over time which is very useful in certain performance critical domains
we introduce modular framework for distributed abstract argumentation where the argumentation context that is information about preferences among arguments values validity reasoning mode skeptical vs credulous and even the chosen semantics can be explicitly represented the framework consists of collection of abstract argument systems connected via mediators each mediator integrates information coming from connected argument systems thereby handling conflicts within this information and provides the context used in particular argumentation module the framework can be used in different directions eg for hierarchic argumentation as typically found in legal reasoning or to model group argumentation processes

we propose to exploit three valued abstraction to stochastic systems in compositional way this combines the strengths of an aggressive state based abstraction technique with compositional modeling applying this principle to interactive markov chains yields abstract models that combine interval markov chains and modal transition systems in natural and orthogonal way we prove the correctness of our technique for parallel and symmetric composition and show that it yields lower bounds for minimal and upper bounds for maximal timed reachability probabilities
innovation in the fields of wireless data communications mobile devices and biosensor technology enables the development of new types of monitoring systems that provide people with assistance anywhere and at any time in this paper we present an architecture useful to build those kind of systems that monitor data streams generated by biological sensors attached to mobile users we pay special attention to three aspects related to the system efficiency selection of the optimal granularity that is the selection of the size of the input data stream package that has to be acquired in order to start new processing cycle the possible use of compression techniques to store and send the acquired input data stream and finally the performance of local analysis versus remote one moreover we introduce two particular real systems to illustrate the suitability and applicability of our proposal an anywhere and at any time monitoring system of heart arrhythmias and an apnea monitoring system
to carry out work assignments small groups distributed within larger enterprise often need to share documents among themselves while shielding those documents from others eyes in this situation users need an indexing facility that can quickly locate relevant documents that they are allowed to access without leaking information about the remaining documents imposing large management burden as users groups and documents evolve or requiring users to agree on central completely trusted authority to address this problem we propose the concept of confidentiality which captures the degree of information leakage from an index about the terms contained in inaccessible documents then we propose the confidential zerber indexing facility for sensitive documents which uses secret splitting and term merging to provide tunable limits on information leakage even under statistical attacks requires only limited trust in central indexing authority and is extremely easy to use and administer experiments with real world data show that zerber offers excellent performance for index insertions and lookups while requiring only modest amount of storage space and network bandwidth

requirements related scenarios capture typical examples of system behaviors through sequences of desired interactions between the software to be and its environment their concrete narrative style of expression makes them very effective for eliciting software requirements and for validating behavior models however scenarios raise coverage problems as they only capture partial histories of interaction among system component instances moreover they often leave the actual requirements implicit numerous efforts have therefore been made recently to synthesize requirements or behavior models inductively from scenarios two problems arise from those efforts on the one hand the scenarios must be complemented with additional input such as state assertions along episodes or flowcharts on such episodes this makes such techniques difficult to use by the nonexpert end users who provide the scenarios on the other hand the generated state machines may be hard to understand as their nodes generally convey no domain specific properties their validation by analysts complementary to model checking and animation by tools may therefore be quite difficult this paper describes tool supported techniques that overcome those two problems our tool generates labeled transition system lts for each system component from simple forms of message sequence charts msc taken as examples or counterexamples of desired behavior no additional input is required global lts for the entire system is synthesized first this lts covers all scenario examples and excludes all counterexamples it is inductively generated through an interactive procedure that extends known learning techniques for grammar induction the procedure is incremental on training examples it interactively produces additional scenarios that the end user has to classify as examples or counterexamples of desired behavior the lts synthesis procedure may thus also be used independently for requirements elicitation through scenario questions generated by the tool the synthesized system lts is then projected on local lts for each system component for model validation by analysts the tool generates state invariants that decorate the nodes of the local lts
some tasks in dataspace loose collection of heterogeneous data sources require integration of fine grained data from diverse sources this work is often done by end users knowledgeable about the domain who copy and paste data into spreadsheet or other existing application inspired by this kind of work in this paper we define data curation setting characterized by data that are explicitly selected copied and then pasted into target dataset where they can be confirmed or replaced rows and columns in the target may also be combined for example when redundant each of these actions is an integration decision often of high quality that when taken together comprise the provenance of data value in the target in this paper we define conceptual model for data and provenance for these user actions and we show how questions about data provenance can be answered we note that our model can be used in automated data curation as well as in setting with the manual activity we emphasize in our examples

in this paper we present the infocious web search engine our goal in creating infocious is to improve the way people find information on the web by resolving ambiguities present in natural language text this is achieved by performing linguistic analysis on the content of the web pages we index which is departure from existing web search engines that return results mainly based on keyword matching this additional step of linguistic processing gives infocious two main advantages first infocious gains deeper understanding of the content of web pages so it can better match users queries with indexed documents and therefore can improve relevancy of the returned results second based on its linguistic processing infocious can organize and present the results to the user in more intuitive ways in this paper we present the linguistic processing technologies that we incorporated in infocious and how they are applied in helping users find information on the web more efficiently we discuss the various components in the architecture of infocious and how each of them benefits from the added linguistic processing finally we experimentally evaluate the performance of component which leverages linguistic information in order to categorize web pages
the problem of building scalable shared memory multiprocessor can be reduced to that of building scalable memory hierarchy assuming interprocessor communication is handled by the memory system in this paper we describe the vmp mc design distributed parallel multi computer based on the vmp multiprocessor design that is intended to provide set of building blocks for configuring machines from one to several thousand processors vmp mc uses memory hierarchy based on shared caches ranging from on chip caches to board level caches connected by busses to at the bottom high speed fiber optic ring in addition to describing the building block components of this architecture we identify the key performance issues associated with the design and provide performance evaluation of these issues using trace drive simulation and measurements from the vmp this work was sponsored in part by the defense advanced research projects agency under contract
we propose in this paper very fast feature selection technique based on conditional mutual information by picking features which maximize their mutual information with the class to predict conditional to any feature already picked it ensures the selection of features which are both individually informative and two by two weakly dependant we show that this feature selection method outperforms other classical algorithms and that naive bayesian classifier built with features selected that way achieves error rates similar to those of state of the art methods such as boosting or svms the implementation we propose selects features among based on training set of examples in tenth of second on standard ghz pc
this paper examines the usability issues involved in ticketless travelling with an airport train the main contribution of this paper is that it describes actual use situations in detail we show how users intentions are difficult to anticipate unless in explicit communication eg with people whose job it is to help out with using the system being conspicuously assisted however only aggravates situation where users usually prefer anonymity given private in public type of design users had little chance of learning from watching others moreover users were quickly annoyed when they struggled with the machine they seemed to treat it as an agent for the provider rather than an assistant or tool for themselves at the end of this paper we outline and illustrate some new design ideas which we think ought to be considered for future designs of it in public spaces
heterogeneous architectures that integrate mix of big and small cores are very attractive because they can achieve high single threaded performance while enabling high performance thread level parallelism with lower energy costs despite their benefits they pose significant challenges to the operating system software thread scheduling is one of the most critical challenges in this paper we propose bias scheduling for heterogeneous systems with cores that have different microarchitectures and performancewe identify key metrics that characterize an application bias namely the core type that best suits its resource needs by dynamically monitoring application bias the operating system is able to match threads to the core type that can maximize system throughput bias scheduling takes advantage of this by influencing the existing scheduler to select the core type that bests suits the application when performing load balancing operations bias scheduling can be implemented on top of most existing schedulers since its impact is limited to changes in the load balancing code in particular we implemented it over the linux scheduler on real system that models microarchitectural differences accurately and found that it can improve system performance significantly and in proportion to the application bias diversity present in the workload unlike previous work bias scheduling does not require sampling of cpi on all core types or offline profiling we also expose the limits of dynamic voltage frequency scaling as an evaluation vehicle for heterogeneous systems
simulation of an application is popular and reliable approach to find the optimal configuration of level one cache memory for an application specific embedded system processor however long simulation time is one of the main disadvantages of simulation based approaches in this paper we propose new and fast simulation method super set simulator susesim while previous methods use top down searching strategy susesim utilizes bottom up search strategy along with new elaborate data structure to reduce the search space to determine cache hit or miss susesim can simulate hundreds of cache configurations simultaneously by reading an application's memory request trace just once total number of cache hits and misses are accurately recorded depending on different cache block sizes and benchmark applications susesim can reduce the number of tags to be checked by up to compared to the existing fastest simulation approach the crcb algorithm with the help of faster search and an easy to maintain data structure susesim can be up to faster in simulating memory requests compared to the crcb algorithm
we address the development of normalization theory for object oriented data models that have common features to support objects we first provide an extension of functional dependencies to cope with the richer semantics of relationships between objects called path dependency local dependency and global dependency constraints using these dependency constraints we provide normal forms for object oriented data models based on the notions of user interpretation user specified dependency constraints and object model in constrast to conventional data models in which normalized object has unique interpretation in object oriented data models an object may have many multiple interpretations that form the model for that object an object will then be in normal form if and only if the user's interpretation is derivable from the model of the object our normalization process is by nature iiterative in which objects are restructured until their models reflect the user's interpretation
in this paper we propose an efficient text classification method using term projection firstly we use modified statistic to project terms into predefined categories which is more efficient compared to other clustering methods afterwards we utilize the generated clusters as features to represent the documents the classification is then performed in rule based manner or via svm experiment results show that our modified statistic feature selection method outperforms traditional statistic especially at lower dimensionalities and our method is also more efficient than latent semantic analysis lsa on homogeneous dataset meanwhile we can reduce the feature dimensionality by three orders of magnitude to save training and testing cost and maintain comparable accuracy moreover we could use small training set to gain an approximately improvement on heterogeneous dataset as compared to traditional method which indicates that our method has better generalization capability
rough sets are widely used in feature subset selection and attribute reduction in most of the existing algorithms the dependency function is employed to evaluate the quality of feature subset the disadvantages of using dependency are discussed in this paper and the problem of forward greedy search algorithm based on dependency is presented we introduce the consistency measure to deal with the problems the relationship between dependency and consistency is analyzed it is shown that consistency measure can reflects not only the size of decision positive region like dependency but also the sample distribution in the boundary region therefore it can more finely describe the distinguishing power of an attribute set based on consistency we redefine the redundancy and reduct of decision system we construct forward greedy search algorithm to find reducts based on consistency what's more we employ cross validation to test the selected features and reduce the overfitting features in reduct the experimental results with uci data show that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient
aligning structures often referred to as docking or registration is frequently required in fields such as computer science robotics and structural biology the task of aligning the structures is usually automated but due to noise and imprecision the user often needs to evaluate the results before final decision can be made the solutions involved are of multidimensional nature and normally densely populated therefore some form of visualization is necessary especially if users want to achieve higher level understanding such as solution symmetry or clustering from the data we have developed system that provides two views of the data one view places focus on the orientation of the solutions and the other focuses on translations solutions within the views are crosslinked using various visual cues users are also able to apply various filters intelligently reducing the solution set we applied the visualization to data generated by the automated cryo em process of docking molecular structures into electron density maps current systems in this field only allow for visual representation of single solution or numerical list of the data we evaluated the system through multi phase user study and found that the users were able to gain better high level understanding of the data even in cases of relatively small solution sets
in collaborative software development projects tasks are often used as mechanism to coordinate and track shared development work modern development environments provide explicit support for task management where tasks are typically organized and managed through predefined categories although there have been many studies that analyze data available from task management systems there has been relatively little work on the design of task management tools in this paper we explore how tagging with freely assigned keywords provides developers with lightweight mechanism to further categorize and annotate development tasks we investigate how tags that are frequently used over long period of time reveal the need for additional predefined categories of keywords in task management tool support finally we suggest future work to explore how integrated lightweight tool features in development environment may improve software development practices

concurrent programs are notorious for containing errors that are difficult to reproduce and diagnose two common kinds of concurrency errors are data races and atomicity violations informally atomicity means that executing methods concurrently is equivalent to executing them serially several static and dynamic run time analysis techniques exist to detect potential races and atomicity violations run time checking may miss errors in unexecuted code and incurs significant run time overhead on the other hand run time checking generally produces fewer false alarms than static analysis this is significant practical advantage since diagnosing all of the warnings from static analysis of large codebases may be prohibitively expensivethis paper explores the use of static analysis to significantly decrease the overhead of run time checking our approach is based on type system for analyzing data races and atomicity type discovery algorithm is used to obtain types for as much of the program as possible complete type inference for this type system is np hard and parts of the program might be untypable warnings from the typechecker are used to identify parts of the program from which run time checking can safely be omitted the approach is completely automatic scalable to very large programs and significantly reduces the overhead of run time checking for data races and atomicity violations
there are three common challenges in real world classification applications ie how to use domain knowledge how to resist noisy samples and how to use unlabeled data to address these problems novel classification framework called mutually beneficial learning mbl is proposed in this paper mbl integrates two learning steps together in the first step the underlying local structures of feature space are discovered through learning process the result provides necessary capability to resist noisy samples and prepare better input for the second step where consecutive classification process is further applied to the result these two steps are iteratively performed until stop condition is met different from traditional classifiers the output of mbl consists of two components common classifier and set of rules corresponding to local structures in application test sample is first matched with the discovered rules if matched rule is found the label of the rule is assigned to the sample otherwise the common classifier will be utilized to classify the sample we applied the mbl to online news classification and our experimental results showed that mbl is significantly better than naïve bayes and svm even when the data is noisy or partially labeled
in state based testing it is common to include verdicts within test cases the result of the test case being the verdict reached by the test run in addition approaches that reason about test effectiveness or produce tests that are guaranteed to find certain classes of faults are often based on either fault domain or set of test hypotheses this article considers how the presence of fault domain or test hypotheses affects our notion of test verdict the analysis reveals the need for new verdicts that provide more information than the current verdicts and for verdict functions that return verdict based on set of test runs rather than single test run the concepts are illustrated in the contexts of testing from nondeterministic finite state machine and the testing of datatype specified using an algebraic specification language but are potentially relevant whenever fault domains or test hypotheses are used
program dependence information is useful for variety of software testing and maintenance tasks properly defined control and data dependencies can be used to identify semantic dependencies to function effectively on whole programs tools that utilize dependence information require information about interprocedural dependencies dependencies that exist because of interactions among procedures many techniques for computing data and control dependencies exist however in our search of the literature we find only one attempt to define and compute interprocedural control dependencies unfortunately that approach can omit important control dependencies and incorrectly identifies control dependencies for large class of programs this paper presents definition of interprocedural control dependence that supports the relationship of control and data dependence to semantic dependence an efficient algorithm for calculating interprocedural control dependencies and empirical results obtained by our implementation of the algorithm
there has been much recent interest in on line data mining existing mining algorithms designed for stored data are either not applicable or not effective on data streams where real time response is often needed and data characteristics change frequently therefore researchers have been focusing on designing new and improved algorithms for on line mining tasks such as classification clustering frequent itemsets mining pattern matching etc relatively little attention has been paid to designing dsmss which facilitate and integrate the task of mining data streams ie stream systems that provide inductive functionalities analogous to those provided by weka and ms ole db for stored data in this paper we propose the notion of an inductive dsms system that besides providing rich library of inter operable functions to support the whole mining process also supports the essentials of dsms including optimization of continuous queries load shedding synoptic constructs and non stop computing ease of use and extensibility are additional desiderata for the proposed inductive dsms we first review the many challenges involved in realizing such system and then present our approach of extending the stream mill dsms toward that goal our system features powerful query language where mining methods are expressed via aggregates for generic streams and arbitrary windows ii library of fast and light mining algorithms and iii an architecture that makes it easy to customize and extend existing mining methods and introduce new ones
we study selectivity estimation techniques for set similarity queries wide variety of similarity measures for sets have been proposed in the past in this work we concentrate on the class of weighted similarity measures eg tf idf and bm cosine similarity and variants and design selectivity estimators based on priori constructed samples first we study the pitfalls associated with straightforward applications of random sampling and argue that care needs to be taken in how the samples are constructed uniform random sampling yields very low accuracy while query sensitive realtime sampling is more expensive than exact solutions both in cpu and cost we show how to build robust samples priori based on existing synopses for distinct value estimation we prove the accuracy of our technique theoretically and verify its performance experimentally our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than exact solutions and has very small space overhead
web applications support many of our daily activities but they often have security problems and their accessibility makes them easy to exploit in cross site scripting xss an attacker exploits the trust web client browser has for trusted server and executes injected script on the browser with the server's privileges in xss constituted the largest class of newly reported vulnerabilities making it the most prevalent class of attacks today web applications have xss vulnerabilities because the validation they perform on untrusted input does not suffice to prevent that input from invoking browser's javascript interpreter and this validation is particularly difficult to get right if it must admit some html mark up most existing approaches to finding xss vulnerabilities are taint based and assume input validation functions to be adequate so they either miss real vulnerabilities or report many false positives this paper presents static analysis for finding xss vulnerabilities that directly addresses weak or absent input validation our approach combines work on tainted information flow with string analysis proper input validation is difficult largely because of the many ways to invoke the javascript interpreter we face the same obstacle checking for vulnerabilities statically and we address it by formalizing policy based on the wc recommendation the firefox source code and online tutorials about closed source browsers we provide effective checking algorithms based on our policy we implement our approach and provide an extensive evaluation that finds both known and unknown vulnerabilities in real world web applications
an important but very expensive primitive operation of high dimensional databases is the nearest neighbor knn similarity join the operation combines each point of one dataset with its knns in the other dataset and it provides more meaningful query results than the range similarity join such an operation is useful for data mining and similarity search in this paper we propose novel knn join algorithm called the gorder or the ordering knn join method gorder is block nested loop join method that exploits sorting join scheduling and distance computation filtering and reduction to reduce both and cpu costs it sorts input datasets into the order and applied the scheduled block nested loop join on the ordered data the distance computation reduction is employed to further reduce cpu cost it is simple and yet efficient and handles high dimensional data efficiently extensive experiments on both synthetic cluster and real life datasets were conducted and the results illustrate that gorder is an efficient knn join method and outperforms existing methods by wide margin
social tagging systems have become increasingly popular for sharing and organizing web resources tag prediction is common feature of social tagging systems social tagging by nature is an incremental process meaning that once user has saved web page with tags the tagging system can provide more accurate predictions for the user based on user's incremental behaviors however existing tag prediction methods do not consider this important factor in which their training and test datasets are either split by fixed time stamp or randomly sampled from larger corpus in our temporal experiments we perform time sensitive sampling on an existing public dataset resulting in new scenario which is much closer to real world in this paper we address the problem of tag prediction by proposing probabilistic model for personalized tag prediction the model is bayesian approach and integrates three factors ego centric effect environmental effects and web page content two methods both intuitive calculation and learning optimization are provided for parameter estimation pure graphbased methods which may have significant constraints such as every user every item and every tag has to occur in at least posts cannot make prediction in most of real world cases while our model improves the measure by over compared to leading algorithm in our real world use case

we consider the problem of sparse interpolation of an approximate multivariate black box polynomial in floating point arithmetic that is both the inputs and outputs of the black box polynomial have some error and all numbers are represented in standard fixed precision floating point arithmetic by interpolating the black box evaluated at random primitive roots of unity we give efficient and numerically robust solutions we note the similarity between the exact ben or tiwari sparse interpolation algorithm and the classical prony's method for interpolating sum of exponential functions and exploit the generalized eigenvalue reformulation of prony's method we analyse the numerical stability of our algorithms and the sensitivity of the solutions as well as the expected conditioning achieved through randomization finally we demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques in practice through numerical experiments and applications
wireless sensor networks consist of system of distributed sensors embedded in the physical world and promise to allow observation of previously unobservable phenomena since they are exposed to unpredictable environments sensor network applications must handle wide variety of faults software errors node and link failures and network partitions the code to manually detect and recover from faults crosscuts the entire application is tedious to implement correctly and efficiently and is fragile in the face of program modifications we investigate language support for modularly managing faults our insight is that such support can be naturally provided as an extension to existing macroprogramming systems for sensor networks in such system programmer describes sensor network application as centralized program compiler then produces equivalent node level programs we describe simple checkpoint api for macroprograms which can be automatically implemented in distributed fashion across the network we also describe declarative annotations that allow programmers to specify checkpointing strategies at higher level of abstraction we have implemented our approach in the kairos macroprogramming system experiments show it to improve application availability by an order of magnitude and incur low messaging overhead
many authors have proposed power management techniques for general purpose processors at the cost of degraded performance such as lower ipc or longer delay some proposals have focused on cache memories because they consume significant fraction of total microprocessor power we propose reconfigurable and adaptive cache microarchitecture based on field programmable technology that is intended to deliver high performance at low energy consumption in this paper we evaluate the performance and energy consumption of run time algorithm when used to manage field programmable data cache the adaptation strategy is based on two techniques learning process provides the best cache configuration for each program phase and recognition process detects program phase changes by using data working set signatures to activate low overhead reconfiguration mechanism our proposals achieve performance improvement and cache energy saving at the same time considering design scenario driven by performance constraints we show that processor execution time and cache energy consumption can be reduced on average by and compared to non adaptive high performance microarchitecture alternatively when energy saving is prioritized and considering non adaptive energy efficient microarchitecture as baseline cache energy and processor execution time are reduced on average by and respectively in addition to comparing to conventional microarchitectures we show that the proposed microarchitecture achieves better performance and more cache energy reduction than other configurable caches
this paper investigates how the vision of the semantic web can be carried over to the realm of email we introduce general notion of semantic email in which an email message consists of structured query or update coupled with corresponding explanatory text semantic email opens the door to wide range of automated email mediated applications with formally guaranteed properties in particular this paper introduces broad class of semantic email processes for example consider the process of sending an email to program committee asking who will attend the pc dinner automatically collecting the responses and tallying them up we define both logical and decision theoretic models where an email process is modeled as set of updates to data set on which we specify goals via certain constraints or utilities we then describe set of inference problems that arise while trying to satisfy these goals and analyze their computational tractability in particular we show that for the logical model it is possible to automatically infer which email responses are acceptable wrt set of constraints in polynomial time and for the decision theoretic model it is possible to compute the optimal message handling policy in polynomial time in addition we show how to automatically generate explanations for process's actions and identify cases where such explanations can be generated in polynomial time finally we discuss our publicly available implementation of semantic email and outline research challenges in this realm

drawback of structured prediction methods is that parameter estimation requires repeated inference which is intractable for general structures in this paper we present an approximate training algorithm called piecewise training pw that divides the factors into tractable subgraphs which we call pieces that are trained independently piecewise training can be interpreted as approximating the exact likelihood using belief propagation and different ways of making this interpretation yield different insights into the method we also present an extension to piecewise training called piecewise pseudolikelihood pwpl designed for when variables have large cardinality on several real world natural language processing tasks piecewise training performs superior to besag's pseudolikelihood and sometimes comparably to exact maximum likelihood in addition pwpl performs similarly to pw and superior to standard pseudolikelihood but is five to ten times more computationally efficient than batch maximum likelihood training

path queries have been extensively used to query semistructured data such as the web and xml documents in this paper we introduce weighted path queries an extension of path queries enabling several classes of optimization problems such as the computation of shortest paths to be easily expressed weighted path queries are based on the notion of weighted regular expression ie regular expression whose symbols are associated to weight we characterize the problem of answering weighted path queries and provide an algorithm for computing their answer we also show how weighted path queries can be effectively embedded into query languages for xml data to express in simple and compact form several meaningful research problems
database security research aims to protect database from unintended activities such as authenticated misuse malicious attacks in recent years surviving dbms from an attack is becoming even more crucial because networks have become more open and the increasingly critical role that database servers are playing nowadays unlike the traditional database failure attack recovery mechanisms in this paper we propose light weight dynamic data damage tracking quarantine and recovery dtqr solution we built the dtqr scheme into the kernel of postgresql we comprehensively study this approach from few aspects eg system overhead impact of the intrusion detection system and the experimental results demonstrated that our dtqr can sustain an excellent data service while healing the database server when it is under malicious attack
this paper presents type based solution to the long standing problem of object initialization constructors the conventional mechanism for object initialization have semantics that are surprising to programmers and that lead to bugs they also contribute to the problem of null pointer exceptions which make software less reliable masked types are new type state mechanism that explicitly tracks the initialization state of objects and prevents reading from uninitialized fields in the resulting language constructors are ordinary methods that operate on uninitialized objects and no special default value null is needed in the language initialization of cyclic data structures is achieved with the use of conditionally masked types masked types are modular and compatible with data abstraction the type system is presented in simplified object calculus and is proved to soundly prevent reading from uninitialized fields masked types have been implemented as an extension to java in which compilation simply erases extra type information experience using the extended language suggests that masked types work well on real code

the multiple expected sources of traffic skewness in next generation sensornets ngsn will trigger the need for load balanced point to point routing protocols driven by this fact we present in this paper load balancing primitive namely traffic oblivious load balancing tolb to be used on top of any point to point routing protocol tolb obliviously load balances traffic by pushing the decision making responsibility to the source of any packet without depending on the energy status of the network sensors or on previously taken decisions for similar packets we present theoretical bounds on tolb's performance for special network types such as mesh networks additionally we ran simulations to evaluate tolb's performance on general networks our experimental results show the high benefit in terms of network lifetime and throughput of applying tolb on top of routing schemes to deal with various traffic skewness levels in different sensor deployment scenarios
in this paper we propose an object oriented model for designing hypermedia applications as the object oriented paradigm allows complex and user defined types nonconventional and nonatomic attributes we can take advantage of these capabilities not only for information modelling but also for providing alternative ways for accessing informationa query language is then presented it is based on an object oriented database system query language it combines features of object oriented databases queries and primitives for hypermedia navigation the language offers the possibility of querying both the application domain information and allowing the designers to obtain information about the schema of the applicationwe present some examples of the use of the object oriented model and the query language
this paper reports on study of professional web designers and developers we provide detailed characterization of their knowledge of fundamental programming concepts elicited through card sorting additionally we present qualitative findings regarding their motivation to learn new concepts and the learning strategies they employ we find high level of recognition of basic concepts but we identify number of concepts that they do not fully understand consider difficult to learn and use infrequently we also note that their learning process is motivated by work projects and often follows pattern of trial and error we conclude with implications for end user programming researchers
although researchers have begun to explicitly support end user programmers debugging by providing information to help them find bugs there is little research addressing the right content to communicate to these users the specific semantic content of these debugging communications matters because if the users are not actually seeking the information the system is providing they are not likely to attend to it this paper reports formative empirical study that sheds light on what end users actually want to know in the course of debugging spreadsheet given the availability of set of interactive visual testing and debugging features our results provide in sights into end user debuggers information gaps and further suggest opportunities to improve end user debugging systems support for the things end user debuggers actually want to know
debugging long running multithreaded programs is very challenging problem when using tracing based analyses since such programs are non deterministic reproducing the bug is non trivial and generating and inspecting traces for long running programs can be prohibitively expensive we propose framework in which to overcome the problem of bug reproducibility lightweight logging technique is used to log the events during the original execution when bug is encountered it is reproduced using the generated log and during the replay fine grained tracing technique is employed to collect control flow dependence traces that are then used to locate the root cause of the bug in this paper we address the key challenges resulting due to tracing that is the prohibitively high expense of collecting traces and the significant burden on the user who must examine the large amount of trace information to locate the bug in long running multithreaded program these challenges are addressed through execution reduction that realizes combination of logging and tracing such that traces collected contain only the execution information from those regions of threads that are relevant to the fault this approach is highly effective because we observe that for long running multithreaded programs many threads that execute are irrelevant to the fault hence these threads need not be replayed and traced when trying to reproduce the bug we develop novel lightweight scheme that identifies such threads by observing all the interthread data dependences and removes their execution footprint in the replay run in addition we identify regions of thread executions that need not be replayed or if they must be replayed we determine if they need not be traced following execution reduction the replayed execution takes lesser time to run and it produces much smaller trace than the original execution thus the cost of collecting traces and the effort of examining the traces to locate the fault are greatly reduced
current approaches to modeling the structure and semantics of video recordings restrict its reuse this is because these approaches are either too rigidly structured or too generally structured and so do not represent the structural and semantic regularities of classes of video recordings this paper proposes framework which tackles the problem of reuse by supporting the definition of wide range of models of video recordings and supporting reuse between them examples of the framework's use are presented and examined with respect to different kinds of reuse of video current research and the development of toolset to support the framework
adaptive programs compute with objects just like object oriented programs each task to be accomplished is specified by so called propagation pattern which traverses the receiver object the object traversal is recursive descent via the instance variables where information is collected or propagated along the way propagation pattern consists of name for the task succinct specification of the parts of the receiver object that should be traversed and code fragments to be executed when specific object types are encountered the propagation patterns need to be complemented by class graph which defines the detailed object structure the separation of structure and behavior yields degree of flexibility and understandability not present in traditional object oriented languages for example the class graph can be changed without changing the adaptive program at all we present an efficient implementation of adaptive programs given an adaptive program and class graph we generate an efficient object oriented program for example in moreover we prove the correctness of the core of this translation key assumption in the theorem is that the traversal specifications are consistent with the class graph we prove the soundness of proof system for conservatively checking consistency and we show how to implement it efficiently
we study online social networks in which relationships can be either positive indicating relations such as friendship or negative indicating relations such as opposition or antagonism such mix of positive and negative links arise in variety of online settings we study datasets from epinions slashdot and wikipedia we find that the signs of links in the underlying social networks can be predicted with high accuracy using models that generalize across this diverse range of sites these models provide insight into some of the fundamental principles that drive the formation of signed links in networks shedding light on theories of balance and status from social psychology they also suggest social computing applications by which the attitude of one user toward another can be estimated from evidence provided by their relationships with other members of the surrounding social network
memory based methods for collaborative filtering predict new ratings by averaging weighted ratings between respectively pairs of similar users or items in practice large number of ratings from similar users or similar items are not available due to the sparsity inherent to rating data consequently prediction quality can be poor this paper re formulates the memory based collaborative filtering problem in generative probabilistic framework treating individual user item ratings as predictors of missing ratings the final rating is estimated by fusing predictions from three sources predictions based on ratings of the same item by other users predictions based on different item ratings made by the same user and third ratings predicted based on data from other but similar users rating other but similar items existing user based and item based approaches correspond to the two simple cases of our framework the complete model is however more robust to data sparsity because the different types of ratings are used in concert while additional ratings from similar users towards similar items are employed as background model to smooth the predictions experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods are indeed more robust against data sparsity and give better recommendations
ontologies have proven to be powerful tool for many tasks such as natural language processing and information filtering and retrieval however their development is an error prone and expensive task one approach for this problem is to provide automatic or semi automatic support for ontology construction this work presents the probabilistic relational hierarchy extraction prehe technique an approach for extracting concept hierarchies from text that uses statistical relational learning and natural language processing for combining cues from many state of the art techniques markov logic network has been developed for this task and is described here preliminary evaluation of the proposed approach is also outlined
in color spatial retrieval technique the color information is integrated with the knowledge of the colors spatial distribution to facilitate content based image retrieval several techniques have been proposed in the literature but these works have been developed independently without much comparison in this paper we present an experimental evaluation of three color spatial retrieval techniques mdash the signature based technique the partition based algorithm and the cluster based method we implemented these techniques and compare them on their retrieval effectiveness and retrieval efficiency the experimental study is performed on an image database consisting of images with the proliferation of image retrieval mechanisms and the lack of extensive performance study the experimental results can serve as guidelines in selecting suitable technique and designing new technique
existing studies on time series are based on two categories of distance functions the first category consists of the lp norms they are metric distance functions but cannot support local time shifting the second category consists of distance functions which are capable of handling local time shifting but are nonmetric the first contribution of this paper is the proposal of new distance function which we call erp edit distance with real penalty representing marriage of norm and the edit distance erp can support local time shifting and is metric the second contribution of the paper is the development of pruning strategies for large time series databases given that erp is metric one way to prune is to apply the triangle inequality another way to prune is to develop lower bound on the erp distance we propose such lower bound which has the nice computational property that it can be efficiently indexed with standard tree moreover we show that these two ways of pruning can be used simultaneously for erp distances specifically the false positives obtained from the tree can be further minimized by applying the triangle inequality based on extensive experimentation with existing benchmarks and techniques we show that this combination delivers superb pruning power and search time performance and dominates all existing strategies
people are thirsty for medical information existing web search engines often cannot handle medical search well because they do not consider its special requirements often medical information searcher is uncertain about his exact questions and unfamiliar with medical terminology therefore he sometimes prefers to pose long queries describing his symptoms and situation in plain english and receive comprehensive relevant information from search results this paper presents medsearch specialized medical web search engine to address these challenges medsearch uses several key techniques to improve its usability and the quality of search results first it accepts queries of extended length and reforms long queries into shorter queries by extracting subset of important and representative words this not only significantly increases the query processing speed but also improves the quality of search results second it provides diversified search results lastly it suggests related medical phrases to help the user quickly digest search results and refine the query we evaluated medsearch using medical questions posted on medical discussion forums the results show that medsearch can handle various medical queries effectively and efficiently
information extraction by text segmentation iets applies to cases in which data values of interest are organized in implicit semi structured records available in textual sources eg postal addresses bibliographic information ads it is an important practical problem that has been frequently addressed in the recent literature in this paper we introduce ondux on demand unsupervised information extraction new unsupervised probabilistic approach for iets as other unsupervised iets approaches ondux relies on information available on pre existing data to associate segments in the input string with attributes of given domain unlike other approaches we rely on very effective matching strategies instead of explicit learning strategies the effectiveness of this matching strategy is also exploited to disambiguate the extraction of certain attributes through reinforcement step that explores sequencing and positioning of attribute values directly learned on demand from test data with no previous human driven training feature unique to ondux this assigns to ondux high degree of flexibility and results in superior effectiveness as demonstrated by the experimental evaluation we report with textual sources from different domains in which ondux is compared with state of art iets approach
this paper presents technique called register value prediction rvp which uses type of locality called register value reuse by predicting that an instruction will produce the value that is already stored in the destination register we eliminate the need for large value buffers to enable value prediction even without the large buffers register value prediction can be made as or more effective than last value prediction particularly with the aid of compiler management of values in the register fileboth static and dynamic register value prediction techniques are demonstrated to exploit register value reuse the former requiring minimal instruction set architecture changes and the latter requiring set of small confidence counters we show an average gain of with dynamic rvp and moderate compiler assistance on next generation processor and on wide processor
we continue to investigate the direct style transformation by extending it to programs requiring call with current continuation aka call cc the direct style ds and the continuation passing style cps transformations form galois connection this pair of functions has place in the programmer's toolbox mdash yet we are not aware of the existence of any other ds transformer starting from our ds transformer towards pure call by value functional terms scheme we extend it with counting analysis to detect non canonical occurrences of continuation the declaration of such continuation is translated into call cc and its application into the application of the corresponding first class continuation we also present staged versions of the ds and of the cps transformations where administrative reductions are separated from the actual translation and where the actual translations are carried out by local structure preserving rewriting rules these staged transformations are used to prove the galois continuation together the cps and the ds transformations enlarge the class of programs that can be manipulated on semantic basis we illustrate this point with partial evaluation by specializing scheme program with respect to static part of its input the program uses coroutines this illustration achieves first static coroutine is executed statically and its computational content is inlined in the residual program

the increasing complexity of applications on handheld devices requires the development of rich new interaction methods specifically designed for resource limited mobile use contexts one appealingly convenient approach to this problem is to use device motions as input paradigm in which the currently dominant interaction metaphors are gesture recognition and visually mediated scrolling however neither is ideal the former suffers from fundamental problems in the learning and communication of gestural patterns while the latter requires continual visual monitoring of the mobile device task that is undesirable in many mobile contexts and also inherently in conflict with the act of moving device to control it this paper proposes an alternate approach gestural menu technique inspired by marking menus and designed specifically for the characteristics of motion input it uses rotations between targets occupying large portions of angular space and emphasizes kinesthetic eyes free interaction three evaluations are presented two featuring an abstract user interface ui and focusing on how user performance changes when the basic system parameters of number size and depth of targets are manipulated these studies show that version of the menu system containing commands yields optimal performance compares well against data from the previous literature and can be used effectively eyes free without graphical feedback the final study uses full graphical ui and untrained users to demonstrate that the system can be rapidly learnt together these three studies rigorously validate the system design and suggest promising new directions for handheld motion based uis
efficiently building and maintaining resilient regular graphs is important for many applications such graphs must be easy to build and maintain in the presence of node additions and deletions they must also have high resilience connectivity typically algorithms use offline techniques to build regular graphs with strict bounds on resilience and such techniques are not designed to maintain these properties in the presence of online additions deletions and failures on the other hand random regular graphs are easy to construct and maintain and provide good properties with high probability but without strict guarantees in this paper we introduce new class of graphs that we call resilient random regular graphs and present technique to create and maintain graphs the graphs meld the desirable properties of random regular graphs and regular graphs with strict structural properties they are efficient to create and maintain and additionally are highly connected ie node and edge connected in the worst case we present the graph building and maintenance techniques present proofs for graph connectedness and various properties of graphs we believe that graphs will be useful in many communication applications

with more computing platforms connected to the internet each day computer system security has become critical issue one of the major security problems is execution of malicious injected code in this paper we propose new processor extensions that allow execution of trusted instructions only the proposed extensions verify instruction block signatures in run time signatures are generated during trusted installation process using multiple input signature register misr and stored in an encrypted form the coefficients of the misr and the key used for signature encryption are based on hidden processor key signature verification is done in the background concurrently with program execution thus reducing negative impact on performance the preliminary results indicate that the proposed processor extensions will prevent execution of any unauthorized code at relatively small increase in system complexity and execution time
radio frequency identification is gaining broader adoption in many areas one of the challenges in implementing an rfid based system is dealing with anomalies in rfid reads small number of anomalies can translate into large errors in analytical results conventional eager approaches cleanse all data upfront and then apply queries on cleaned data however this approach is not feasible when several applications define anomalies and corrections on the same data set differently and not all anomalies can be defined beforehand this necessitates anomaly handling at query time we introduce deferred approach for detecting and correcting rfid data anomalies each application specifies the detection and the correction of relevant anomalies using declarative sequence based rules an application query is then automatically rewritten based on the cleansing rules that the application has specified to provide answers over cleaned data we show that naive approach to deferred cleansing that applies rules without leveraging query information can be prohibitive we develop two novel rewrite methods both of which reduce the amount of data to be cleaned by exploiting predicates in application queries while guaranteeing correct answers we leverage standardized sql olap functionality to implement rules specified in declarative sequence based language this allows efficient evaluation of cleansing rules using existing query processing capabilities of dbms our experimental results show that deferred cleansing is affordable for typical analytic queries over rfid data
modern window based user interface systems generate user interface events as natural products of their normal operation because such events can be automatically captured and because they indicate user behavior with respect to an application's user interface they have long been regarded as potentially fruitful source of information regarding application usage and usability however because user interface events are typically voluminos and rich in detail automated support is generally required to extract information at level of abstraction that is useful to investigators interested in analyzing application usage or evaluating usability this survey examines computer aided techniques used by hci practitioners and researchers to extract usability related information from user interface events framework is presented to help hci practitioners and researchers categorize and compare the approaches that have been or might fruitfully be applied to this problem because many of the techniques in the research literature have not been evaluated in practice this survey provides conceptual evaluation to help identify some of the relative merits and drawbacks of the various classes of approaches ideas for future research in this area are also presented this survey addresses the following questions how might user interface events be used in evaluating usability how are user interface events related to other forms of usability data what are the key challenges faced by investigators wishing to exploit this data what approaches have been brought to bear on this problem and how do they compare to one another what are some of the important open research questions in this area
in recent years there has been tremendous growth of online text information related to the explosive growth of the web which provides very useful information resource to all types of users who access the internet for various purposes the major demand of these users is to get required information within the stipulated time humans can recognise subjects of document fields by reading only some relevant specific words called field association words in the field this paper presents method of relevant estimation among fields by using field association words two methods are proposed in this paper first is method of extraction of co occurrence among fields and the second is method of judgment of similarity among fields as the methods of relevant estimation among fields from experimental results precision of the first method is high when relevance among fields is very high and considering direction of fields preferable results are obtained in the second method
in order to obtain machine understandable semantics for web resources research on the semantic web tries to annotate web resources with concepts and relations from explicitly defined formal ontologies this kind of formal annotation is usually done manually or semi automatically in this paper we explore complement approach that focuses on the social annotations of the web which are annotations manually made by normal web users without pre defined formal ontology compared to the formal annotations although social annotations are coarse grained informal and vague they are also more accessible to more people and better reflect the web resources meaning from the users point of views during their actual usage of the web resources using social bookmark service as an example we show how emergent semantics can be statistically derived from the social annotations furthermore we apply the derived emergent semantics to discover and search shared web bookmarks the initial evaluation on our implementation shows that our method can effectively discover semantically related web bookmarks that current social bookmark service can not discover easily
miss rate curves mrcs are useful in number of contexts in our research online cache mrcs enable us to dynamically identify optimal cache sizes when cache partitioning shared cache multicore processor obtaining mrcs has generally been assumed to be expensive when done in software and consequently their usage for online optimizations has been limited to address these problems and opportunities we have developed low overhead software technique to obtain mrcs online on current processors exploiting features available in their performance monitoring units so that no changes to the application source code or binaries are required our technique called rapidmrc requires single probing period of roughly million processor cycles ms and subsequently million cycles ms to process the data we demonstrate its accuracy by comparing the obtained mrcs to the actual mrcs of applications taken from speccpu speccpu and specjbb we show that rapidmrc can be applied to sizing cache partitions helping to achieve performance improvements of up to
in this paper we present framework for mining diverging patterns new type of contrast patterns whose frequency changes significantly differently in two data sets eg it changes from relatively low to relatively high value in one dataset but from high to low in the other in this framework measure called diverging ratio is defined and used to discover diverging patterns we use four dimensional vector to represent pattern and define the pattern's diverging ratio based on the angular difference between its vectors in two datasets an algorithm is proposed to mine diverging patterns from pair of datasets which makes use of standard frequent pattern mining algorithm to compute vector components efficiently we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on real world datasets showing that the method can reveal novel knowledge from large databases
we present formal framework to specify and test systems presenting both soft and hard deadlines while hard deadlines must be always met on time soft deadlines can be sometimes met in different time usually higher from the specified one it is this characteristic to formally define sometimes what produces several reasonable alternatives to define appropriate implementation relations that is relations to decide wether an implementation is correct with respect to specification in addition to introduce these relations we define testing framework to test implementations
information extraction ie systems are prone to false hits for variety of reasons and we observed that many of these false hi ts occur in sentences that contain subjective language eg opinions emotions and sentiments motivated by these observations we explore the idea of using subjectivity analysis to improve the precision of information extraction systems in this paper we describe an ie system that uses subjective sentence classifier to filter its extractions we experimented with several different strategies for using the subjectivity classifications including an aggressive strategy that discards all extractions found in subjective sentences and more complex strategies that selectively discard extractions we evaluated the performance of these different approaches on the muc terrorism data set we found that indiscriminately filtering extractions from subjective sentences was overly aggressive but more selective filtering strategies improved ie precision with minimal recall loss
we present novel counting network construction where the number of input wires is smaller than or equal to the number of output wires the depth of our network is lg which depends only on in contrast the amortized contention of the network depends on the number of concurrent processes and the parameters and this offers more flexibility than all previously known networks with the same number of input and output wires whose contention depends only on two parameters and in case wlgw by choosing wlgw the contention of our network is nlgw which improves by logarithmic factor of over all previously known networks with wires
lot of recent work has focussed on bulk loading of data into multidimensional index structures in order to efficiently construct such structures for large datasets in this paper we address this problem with particular focus on trees mdash which are an important class of index structures used widely in commercial database systems we propose new technique which as opposed to the current technique of inserting data one by one bulk inserts entire new datasets into an active tree this technique called stlt for small tree large tree considers the new dataset as an tree itself small tree identifies and prepares suitable location in the original tree large tree for insertion and lastly performs the insert of the small tree into the large tree besides an analytical cost model of stlt extensive experimental studies both on synthetic and real gis data sets are also reported these experiments not only compare stlt against the conventional technique but also evaluate the suitability and limitations of stlt under different conditions such as varying buffer sizes ratio between existing and new data sizes and skewness of new data with respect to the whole spatial region we find that stlt does much better in average about than the existing technique for skewed datasets as well for large sizes of both the large tree and the small tree in terms of insertion time while keeping comparable query tree quality stlt consistently outperforms the alternate technique in all other circumstances in terms of bulk insertion time especially even up to for the cases when the area of new data sets covers up to of the global region covered by the existing index tree however at the cost of deteriorating resulting tree quality

this article discusses potential application of radio frequency identification rfid and collaborative filtering for targeted advertising in grocery stores every day hundreds of items in grocery stores are marked down for promotional purposes whether these promotions are effective or not depends primarily on whether the customers are aware of them or not and secondarily whether the customers are interested in the products or not currently the companies are incapable of influencing the customers decisionmaking process while they are shopping however the capabilities of rfid technology enable us to transfer the recommendation systems of commerce to grocery stores in our model using rfid technology we get real time information about the products placed in the cart during the shopping process based on that information we inform the customer about those promotions in which the customer is likely to be interested in the selection of the product advertised is dynamic decision making process since it is based on the information of the products placed inside the cart while customer is shopping collaborative filtering will be used for the identification of the advertised product and bayesian networks will be used for the application of collaborative filtering we are assuming scenario where all products have rfid tags and grocery carts are equipped with rfid readers and screens that would display the relevant promotions
modern computer systems permit users to access protected information from remote locations in certain secure environments it would be desirable to restrict this access to particular computer or set of computers existing solutions of machine level authentication are undesirable for two reasons first they do not allow fine grained application layer access decisions second they are vulnerable to insider attacks in which trusted administrator acts maliciously in this work we describe novel approach using secure hardware that solves these problems in our design multiple administrators are required for installation of system after installation the authentication privileges are physically linked to that machine and no administrator can bypass these controls we define an administrative model and detail the requirements for an authentication protocol to be compatible with our methodology our design presents some challenges for large scale systems in addition to the benefit of reduced maintenance

the analysis of movement of people vehicles and other objects is important for carrying out research in social and scientific domains the study of movement behavior of spatiotemporal entities helps enhance the quality of service in decision making in real applications however the spread of certain entities such as diseases or rumor is difficult to observe compared to the movement of people vehicles or animals we can only infer their locations in certain region of space time on the basis of observable events in this paper we propose new model called as moving phenomenon to represent time varying phenomena over geotime tagged contents on the web the most important feature of this model is the integration of thematic dimension into an event based spatiotemporal data model by using the proposed model user can aggregate relevant contents relating to an interesting phenomenon and perceive its movement behavior further the model also enables user to navigate the spatial temporal and thematic information of the contents along all the three dimensions finally we present an example of typhoons to illustrate moving phenomena and draw comparison between the movement of the moving phenomenon created using information from news articles on the web and that of the actual typhoon
we present detailed study of network evolution by analyzing four large online social networks with full temporal information about node and edge arrivals for the first time at such large scale we study individual node arrival and edge creation processes that collectively lead to macroscopic properties of networks using methodology based on the maximum likelihood principle we investigate wide variety of network formation strategies and show that edge locality plays critical role in evolution of networks our findings supplement earlier network models based on the inherently non local preferential attachment based on our observations we develop complete model of network evolution where nodes arrive at prespecified rate and select their lifetimes each node then independently initiates edges according to gap process selecting destination for each edge according to simple triangle closing model free of any parameters we show analytically that the combination of the gap distribution with the node lifetime leads to power law out degree distribution that accurately reflects the true network in all four cases finally we give model parameter settings that allow automatic evolution and generation of realistic synthetic networks of arbitrary scale

many distributed monitoring applications of wireless sensor networks wsns require the location information of sensor node in this article we address the problem of enabling nodes of wireless sensor networks to determine their location in an untrusted environment known as the secure localization problem we propose novel range independent localization algorithm called serloc that is well suited to resource constrained environment such as wsn serloc is distributed algorithm based on two tier network architecture that allows sensors to passively determine their location without interacting with other sensors we show that serloc is robust against known attacks on wsns such as the wormhole attack the sybil attack and compromise of network entities and analytically compute the probability of success for each attack we also compare the performance of serloc with state of the art range independent localization schemes and show that serloc has better performance
in recent years network coding has emerged as new communication paradigm that can significantly improve the efficiency of network protocols by requiring intermediate nodes to mix packets before forwarding them recently several real world systems have been proposed to leverage network coding in wireless networks although the theoretical foundations of network coding are well understood real world system needs to solve plethora of practical aspects before network coding can meet its promised potential these practical design choices expose network coding systems to wide range of attacks we identify two general frameworks inter flow and intra flow that encompass several network coding based systems proposed in wireless networks our systematic analysis of the components of these frameworks reveals vulnerabilities to wide range of attacks which may severely degrade system performance then we identify security goals and design challenges in achieving security for network coding systems adequate understanding of both the threats and challenges is essential to effectively design secure practical network coding systems our paper should be viewed as cautionary note pointing out the frailty of current network coding based wireless systems and general guideline in the effort of achieving security for network coding systems
the real world we live in is mostly perceived through an incredibly large collection of views generated by humans machines and other systems this is the view reality the opsis project concentrates its efforts on dealing with the multifaceted form and complexity of data views including data projection views aggregate views summary views synopses and finally web views in particular opsis deals with the generation the storage organization cubetrees the efficient run time management dynamat of materialized views for data warehouse systems and for web servers with dynamic content webviews
the visual vocabulary is an intermediate level representation which has been proved to be very powerful for addressing object categorization problems it is generally built by vector quantizing set of local image descriptors independently of the object model used for categorizing images we propose here to embed the visual vocabulary creation within the object model construction allowing to make it more suited for object class discrimination and therefore for object categorization we also show that the model can be adapted to perform object level segmentation task without needing any shape model making the approach very adapted to high intra class varying objects
traditional web service discovery is strongly related to the use of service directories especially in the case of mobile web services where both service requestors and providers are mobile the dynamics impose the need for directory based discovery context plays an eminent role with mobility as filtering mechanism that enhances service discovery through the selection of the most appropriate service however current service directory specifications do not focus on mobility of services or context awareness in this paper we propose casd context aware service directory envisioned as context based index for services on top of any traditional service directory and design algorithms for construction search update and merge of such directories furthermore we describe the architecture of our system for context aware service discovery we present prototype implementation and discuss the experimental results as well as the overall evaluation the contribution of this work is the proposal for novel enhanced representation model for context aware service directory
we address the pose mismatch problem which can occur in face verification systems that have only single frontal face image available for training in the framework of bayesian classifier based on mixtures of gaussians the problem is tackled through extending each frontal face model with artificially synthesized models for non frontal views the synthesis methods are based on several implementations of maximum likelihood linear regression mllr as well as standard multi variate linear regression linreg all synthesis techniques rely on prior information and learn how face models for the frontal view are related to face models for non frontal views the synthesis and extension approach is evaluated by applying it to two face verification systems holistic system based on pca derived features and local feature system based on dct derived features experiments on the feret database suggest that for the holistic system the linreg based technique is more suited than the mllr based techniques for the local feature system the results show that synthesis via new mllr implementation obtains better performance than synthesis based on traditional mllr the results further suggest that extending frontal models considerably reduces errors it is also shown that the local feature system is less affected by view changes than the holistic system this can be attributed to the parts based representation of the face and due to the classifier based on mixtures of gaussians the lack of constraints on spatial relations between the face parts allowing for deformations and movements of face areas
views over distributed information sources such as data warehouses rely on the stability of the schemas of underlying databases in the event of meta data changes in the sources such as the deletion of table or column such views may become undefined using meta data about information redundancy views can be evolved as necessary to remain well defined after source meta data changesprevious work in view synchronization focused only on deletions of schema elements we now offer an approach that makes use of additions also our algorithm returns view definitions to previous versions by using knowledge about the history of views and meta data this technology enables us to adapt views to temporary meta data changes by canceling out opposite changes it also allows undo redo operations on meta data last in many cases the resulting evolved views even have an improved information quality in this paper we give formal taxonomy of schema and constraint changes and full description of the proposed history driven view synchronization algorithm for this taxonomy we also prove the history driven view synchronization algorithm to be correct our approach falls in the global as view category of data integration solutions but unlike prior solutions in this category it now also deals with changes in the information space rather than requiring source schemas to remain constant over time
this work addresses the problem of trading off the latency in delivering the answer to the sink at the benefit of balancing the spatial dispersion of the energy consumption among the nodes and consequently prolonging the lifetime in sensor networks typically in response to query that pertains to the data from some geographic region tree structure is constructed and when possible some in network aggregation is performed on the other hand in order to increase the robustness and or balance the load multipath routing is employed motivated by earlier work that combined trees and multipaths in this paper we explore the possibility and the impact of combining multiple trees and multiple multipaths for routing when processing query with respect to given region of interest we present and evaluate two approaches that enable load balancing in terms of alternating among collection of routing structures
short tcp flows may suffer significant response time performance degradations during network congestion unfortunately this creates an incentive for misbehavior by clients of interactive applications eg gaming telnet web to send dummy packets into the network at tcp fair rate even when they have no data to send thus improving their performance in moments when they do have data to send even though no law is violated in this way large scale deployment of such an approach has the potential to seriously jeopardize one of the core internet's principles statistical multiplexing we quantify by means of analytical modeling and simulation gains achievable by the above misbehavior our research indicates that easy to implement application level techniques are capable of dramatically reducing incentives for conducting the above transgressions still without compromising the idea of statistical multiplexing

there is growing wealth of data describing networks of various types including social networks physical networks such as transportation or communication networks and biological networks at the same time there is growing interest in analyzing these networks in order to uncover general laws that govern their structure and evolution and patterns and predictive models to develop better policies and practices however fundamental challenge in dealing with this newly available observational data describing networks is that the data is often of dubious quality it is noisy and incomplete and before any analysis method can be applied the data must be cleaned and missing information inferred in this paper we introduce the notion of graph identification which explicitly models the inference of cleaned output network from noisy input graph it is this output network that is appropriate for further analysis we present an illustrative example and use the example to explore the types of inferences involved in graph identification as well as the challenges and issues involved in combining those inferences we then present simple general approach to combining the inferences in graph identification and experimentally show the utility of our combined approach and how the performance of graph identification is sensitive to the inter dependencies among these inferences
this paper studies the memory system behavior of java programs by analyzing memory reference traces of several specjvm applications running with just in time jit compiler trace information is collected by an exception based tracing tool called jtrace without any instrumentation to the java programs or the jit compilerfirst we find that the overall cache miss ratio is increased due to garbage collection which suffers from higher cache misses compared to the application we also note that going beyond way cache associativity improves the cache miss ratio marginally second we observe that java programs generate substantial amount of short lived objects however the size of frequently referenced long lived objects is more important to the cache performance because it tends to determine the application's working set size finally we note that the default heap configuration which starts from small initial heap size is very inefficient since it invokes garbage collector frequently although the direct costs of garbage collection decrease as we increase the available heap size there exists an optimal heap size which minimizes the total execution time due to the interaction with the virtual memory performance
previous studies of non parametric kernel npk learning usually reduce to solving some semi definite programming sdp problem by standard sdp solver however time complexity of standard interior point sdp solvers could be as high as such intensive computation cost prohibits npk learning applicable to real applications even for data sets of moderate size in this paper we propose an efficient approach to npk learning from side information referred to as simplenpkl which can efficiently learn non parametric kernels from large sets of pairwise constraints in particular we show that the proposed simplenpkl with linear loss has closed form solution that can be simply computed by the lanczos algorithm moreover we show that the simplenpkl with square hinge loss can be re formulated as saddle point optimization task which can be further solved by fast iterative algorithm in contrast to the previous approaches our empirical results show that our new technique achieves the same accuracy but is significantly more efficient and scalable
discovering and unlocking the full potential of complex pervasive environments is still approached in application centric ways set of statically deployed applications often defines the possible interactions within the environment however the increasing dynamics of such environments require more versatile and generic approach which allows the end user to inspect configure and control the overall behavior of such an environment meta ui addresses these needs by providing the end user with an interactive view on physical or virtual environment which can then be observed and manipulated at runtime the meta ui bridges the gap between the resource providers and the end users by abstracting resource's features as executable activities that can be assembled at runtime to reach common goal in order to allow software services to automatically integrate with pervasive computing environment the minimal requirements of the environment's meta ui must be identified and agreed on in this paper we present meta stud goal and service oriented reference framework that supports the creation of meta uis for usage in pervasive environments the framework is validated using two independent implementation approaches designed with different technologies and focuses
case based reasoning cbr was firstly introduced into the area of business failure prediction bfp in the conclusion drawn out in its first application in this area is that cbr is not more applicable than multiple discriminant analysis mda and logit on the contrary there are some arguments which claim that cbr with nearest neighbor nn as its heart is not surely outranked by those machine learning techniques in this research we attempt to investigate whether or not cbr is sensitive to the so called optimal feature subsets in bfp since feature subset is an important factor that accounts for cbr's performance when cbr is used to solve such classification problem the retrieval process of its life cycle is mainly used we use the classical euclidean metric technique to calculate case similarity empirical data two years prior to failure are collected from shanghai stock exchange and shenzhen stock exchange in china four filters ie mda stepwise method logit stepwise method one way anova independent samples test and the wrapper approach of genetic algorithm are employed to generate five optimal feature subsets after data normalization thirty times hold out method is used as assessment of predictive performances by combining leave one out cross validation and hold out method the two statistical baseline models ie mda and logit and the new model of support vector machine are employed as comparative models empirical results indicate that cbr is truly sensitive to optimal feature subsets with data for medium term bfp the stepwise method of mda filter approach is the first choice for cbr to select optimal feature subsets followed by the stepwise method of logit and the wrapper the two filter approaches of anova and test are the fourth choice if mda stepwise method is employed to select optimal feature subset for the cbr system there are no significant difference on predictive performance of medium term bfp between cbr and the other three models ie mda logit svm on the contrary cbr is outperformed by the three models at the significant level of if anova or test is used as feature selection method for cbr
understanding the nature of the workloads and system demands created by users of the world wide web is crucial to properly designing and provisioning web services previous measurements of web client workloads have been shown to exhibit number of characteristic features semi however it is not clear how those features may be changing with time in this study we compare two measurements of web client workloads separated in time by three years both captured from the same computing facility at boston university the older dataset obtained in is well known in the research literature and has been the basis for wide variety of studies the newer dataset was captured in and is comparable in size to the older dataset the new dataset has the drawback that the collection of users measured may no longer be representative of general web users semi however using it has the advantage that many comparisons can be drawn more clearly than would be possible using new different source of measurement our results fall into two categories first we compare the statistical and distributional properties of web requests across the two datasets this serves to reinforce and deepen our understanding of the characteristic statistical properties of web client requests we find that the kinds of distributions that best describe document sizes have not changed between and although specific values of the distributional parameters are different second we explore the question of how the observed differences in the properties of web client requests particularly the popularity and temporal locality properties affect the potential for web file caching in the network we find that for the computing facility represented by our traces between and the benefits of using size based caching policies have diminished semi and the potential for caching requested files in the network has declined

given nodes in social network say authorship network how can we find the node author that is the center piece and has direct or indirect connections to all or most of them for example this node could be the common advisor or someone who started the research area that the nodes belong to isomorphic scenarios appear in law enforcement find the master mind criminal connected to all current suspects gene regulatory networks find the protein that participates in pathways with all or most of the given proteins viral marketing and many moreconnection subgraphs is an important first step handling the case of query nodes then the connection subgraph algorithm finds the intermediate nodes that provide good connection between the two original query nodeshere we generalize the challenge in multiple dimensions first we allow more than two query nodes second we allow whole family of queries ranging from or to and with softand in between finally we design and compare fast approximation and study the quality speed trade offwe also present experiments on the dblp dataset the experiments confirm that our proposed method naturally deals with multi source queries and that the resulting subgraphs agree with our intuition wall clock timing results on the dblp dataset show that our proposed approximation achieve good accuracy for about speedup
animating crowd of characters is an important problem in computer graphics the latest techniques enable highly realistic group motions to be produced in feature animation films and video games however interactive methods have not emerged yet for editing the existing group motion of multiple characters we present an approach to editing group motion as whole while maintaining its neighborhood formation and individual moving trajectories in the original animation as much as possible the user can deform group motion by pinning or dragging individuals multiple group motions can be stitched or merged to form longer or larger group motion while avoiding collisions these editing operations rely on novel graph structure in which vertices represent positions of individuals at specific frames and edges encode neighborhood formations and moving trajectories we employ shape manipulation technique to minimize the distortion of relative arrangements among adjacent vertices while editing the graph structure the usefulness and flexibility of our approach is demonstrated through examples in which the user creates and edits complex crowd animations interactively using collection of group motion clips
many testing and analysis techniques have been developed for inhouse use although they are effective at discovering defects before program is deployed these techniques are often limited due to the complexity of real world code and thus miss program faults it will be the users of the program who eventually experience failures caused by the undetected faults to take advantage of the large number of program runs carried by the users recent work has proposed techniques to collect execution profiles from the users for developers to perform post deployment failure analysis however in order to protect users privacy and to reduce run time overhead such profiles are usually not detailed enough for the developers to identify or fix the root causes of the failures in this paper we propose novel approach to utilize user execution profiles for more effective in house testing and analysis our key insight is that execution profiles for program failures can be used to simplify program while preserving its erroneous behavior by simplifying program and scaling down its complexity according to its profiles in house testing and analysis techniques can be performed more accurately and efficiently and pragmatically program defects that occur more often and are arguably more relevant to users will be given preference during failure analysis specifically we adapt statistical debugging on execution profiles to predict likely failure related code and use syntax directed algorithm to trim failure irrelevant code from program while preserving its erroneous behavior as much as possible we conducted case studies on testing engine cute and software model checker blast to evaluate our technique we used subject programs from the aristotle analysis system and the software artifact infrastructure repository sir our empirical results show that using simplified programs cute and blast find more bugs with improved accuracy and performance they were able to detect and out of more bugs respectively in about half of the time as they took on the original test programs
to offset the effect of read miss penalties on processor utilization in shared memory multiprocessors several software and hardware based data prefetching schemes have been proposed major advantage of hardware techniques is that they need no support from the programmer or compilersequential prefetching is simple hardware controlled prefetching technique which relies on the automatic prefetch of consecutive blocks following the block that misses in the cache thus exploiting spatial locality in its simplest form the number of prefetched blocks on each miss is fixed throughout the execution however since the prefetching efficiency varies during the execution of program we propose to adapt the number of prefetched blocks according to dynamic measure of prefetching effectiveness simulations of this adaptive scheme show reductions of the number of read misses the read penalty and of the execution time by up to and respectively
change detection is an important issue for modern geospatial information systems in this paper we address change detection of areal objects ie objects with closed curve outlines we specifically focus on the detection of movement translation and rotation and or deformation of such objects using aerial imagery the innovative approach we present in this paper combines geometric analysis with our model of differential snakes to support change detection geometric analysis proceeds by comparing the first moments of the two outlines describing the same object in different instances to estimate translation moment information allows us to determine the principal axes and eigenvectors of these outlines and this we can determine object rotation as the angle between these principal axes next we apply polygon clipping techniques to calculate the intersection and difference of these two outlines we use this result to estimate the radial deformation of the object expansion and contraction the results are further refined through the use of our differential snakes model to distinguish true change from the effects of inaccuracy in object determination the aggregation of these tools defines powerful approach for change detection in the paper we present the theoretical background behind these components and experimental results that demonstrate the performance of our approach
coupled transformation occurs when multiple software artifacts must be transformed in such way that they remain consistent with each other for instance when database schema is adapted in the context of system maintenance the persistent data residing in the system's database needs to be migrated to conform to the adapted schema also queries embedded in the application code and any declared referential constraints must be adapted to take the schema changes into account as another example in xml to relational data mapping hierarchical xml schema is mapped to relational sql schema with appropriate referential constraints and the xml documents and queries are converted into relational data and relational queries the lt project is aimed at providing formal basis for coupled transformation this formal basis is found in data refinement theory point free program calculation and strategic term rewriting we formalize the coupled transformation of data type by an algebra of information preserving data refinement steps each witnessed by appropriate data conversion functions refinement steps are modeled by so called two level rewrite rules on type expressions that synthesize conversion functions between redex and reduct while rewriting strategy combinators are used to composed two level rewrite rules into complete rewrite systems point free program calculation is applied to optimized synthesize conversion function to migrate queries and to normalize data type constraints in this paper we provide an overview of the challenges met by the lt project and we give sketch of the solutions offered
in this paper we develop fault tolerant job scheduling strategy in order to tolerate faults gracefully in an economy based grid environment we propose novel adaptive task checkpointing based fault tolerant job scheduling strategy for an economy based grid the proposed strategy maintains fault index of grid resources it dynamically updates the fault index based on successful or unsuccessful completion of an assigned task whenever grid resource broker has tasks to schedule on grid resources it makes use of the fault index from the fault tolerant schedule manager in addition to using time optimization heuristic while scheduling grid job on grid resource the resource broker uses fault index to apply different intensity of task checkpointing inserting checkpoints in task at different intervals to simulate and evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy this paper enhances the gridsim toolkit to exhibit fault tolerance related behavior we also compare checkpointing fault tolerant job scheduling strategy with the well known time optimization heuristic in an economy based grid environment from the measured results we conclude that even in the presence of faults the proposed strategy effectively schedules grid jobs tolerating faults gracefully and executes more jobs successfully within the specified deadline and allotted budget it also improves the overall execution time and minimizes the execution cost of grid jobs
the microprocessor industry is currently struggling with higher development costs and longer design times that arise from exceedingly complex processors that are pushing the limits of instruction level parallelism meanwhile such designs are especially ill suited for important commercial applications such as on line transaction processing oltp which suffer from large memory stall times and exhibit little instruction level parallelism given that commercial applications constitute by far the most important market for high performance servers the above trends emphasize the need to consider alternative processor designs that specifically target such workloads the abundance of explicit thread level parallelism in commercial workloads along with advances in semiconductor integration density identify chip multiprocessing cmp as potentially the most promising approach for designing processors targeted at commercial servers this paper describes the piranha system research prototype being developed at compaq that aggressively exploits chip multi processing by integrating eight simple alpha processor cores along with two level cache hierarchy onto single chip piranha also integrates further on chip functionality to allow for scalable multiprocessor configurations to be built in glueless and modular fashion the use of simple processor cores combined with an industry standard asic design methodology allow us to complete our prototype within short time frame with team size and investment that are an order of magnitude smaller than that of commercial microprocessor our detailed simulation results show that while each piranha processor core is substantially slower than an aggressive next generation processor the integration of eight cores onto single chip allows piranha to outperform next generation processors by up to times on per chip basis on important workloads such as oltp this performance advantage can approach factor of five by using full custom instead of asic logic in addition to exploiting chip multiprocessing the piranha prototype incorporates several other unique design choices including shared second level cache with no inclusion highly optimized cache coherence protocol and novel architecture
we present generalisation of first order rewriting which allows us to deal with terms involving binding operations in an elegant and practical way we use nominal approach to binding in which bound entities are explicitly named rather than using nameless syntax such as de bruijn indices yet we get rewriting formalism which respects conversion and can be directly implemented this is achieved by adapting to the rewriting framework the powerful techniques developed by pitts et al in the freshml projectnominal rewriting can be seen as higher order rewriting with first order syntax and built in conversion we show that standard first order rewriting is particular case of nominal rewriting and that very expressive higher order systems such as klop's combinatory reduction systems can be easily defined as nominal rewriting systems finally we study confluence properties of nominal rewriting
we present novel approach for retrieval of object categories based on novel type of image representation the generalized correlogram gc in our image representation the object is described as constellation of gcs where each one encodes information about some local part and the spatial relations from this part to others ie the part's context we show how such representation can be used with fast procedures that learn the object category with weak supervision and efficiently match the model of the object against large collections of images in the learning stage we show that by integrating our representation with boosting the system is able to obtain compact model that is represented by very few features where each feature conveys key properties about the object's parts and their spatial arrangement in the matching step we propose direct procedures that exploit our representation for efficiently considering spatial coherence between the matching of local parts combined with an appropriate data organization such as inverted files we show that thousands of images can be evaluated efficiently the framework has been applied to different standard databases and we show that our results are favorably compared against state of the art methods in both computational cost and accuracy
we consider an extension of integer linear arithmetic with star operator takes closure under vector addition of the solution set of linear arithmetic subformula we show that the satisfiability problem for this extended language remains in np and therefore np complete our proof uses semilinear set characterization of solutions of integer linear arithmetic formulas as well as generalization of recent result on sparse solutions of integer linear programming problems as consequence of our result we present worst case optimal decision procedures for two np hard problems that were previously not known to be in np the first is the satisfiability problem for logic of sets multisets bags and cardinality constraints which has applications in verification interactive theorem proving and description logics the second is the reachability problem for class of transition systems whose transitions increment the state vector by solutions of integer linear arithmetic formulas
we present compositional program logic for call by value imperative higher order functions with general forms of aliasing which can arise from the use of reference names as function parameters return values content of references and parts of data structures the program logic extends our earlier logic for alias free imperative higher order functions with new modal operators which serve as building blocks for clean structural reasoning about programs and data structures in the presence of aliasing this has been an open issue since the pioneering work by cartwright oppen and morris twenty five years ago we illustrate usage of the logic for description and reasoning through concrete examples including higher order polymorphic quicksort the logical status of the new operators is clarified by translating them into in equalities of reference names the logic is observationally complete in the sense that two programs are observationally indistinguishable if they satisfy the same set of assertions
the input vocabulary for touch screen interaction on handhelds is dramatically limited especially when the thumb must be used to enrich that vocabulary we propose to discriminate among thumb gestures those we call microrolls characterized by zero tangential velocity of the skin relative to the screen surface combining four categories of thumb gestures drags swipes rubbings and microrolls with other classification dimensions we show that at least elemental gestures can be automatically recognized we also report the results of two experiments showing that the roll vs slide distinction facilitates thumb input in realistic copy and paste task relative to existing interaction techniques
the increasing availability and accuracy of eye gaze detection equipment has encouraged its use for both investigation and control in this paper we present novel methods for navigating and inspecting extremely large images solely or primarily using eye gaze control we investigate the relative advantages and comparative properties of four related methods stare to zoom stz in which control of the image position and resolution level is determined solely by the user's gaze position on the screen head to zoom htz and dual to zoom dtz in which gaze control is augmented by head or mouse actions and mouse to zoom mtz using conventional mouse input as an experimental control the need to inspect large images occurs in many disciplines such as mapping medicine astronomy and surveillance here we consider the inspection of very large aerial images of which google earth is both an example and the one employed in our study we perform comparative search and navigation tasks with each of the methods described and record user opinions using the swedish user viewer presence questionnaire we conclude that while gaze methods are effective for image navigation they as yet lag behind more conventional methods and interaction designers may well consider combining these techniques for greatest effect
previous research in real time concurrency control mainly focuses on the schedulability guarantee of hard real time transactions and the reduction of the miss rate of soft real time transactions although many new database applications have significant response time requirements not much work has been done in the joint scheduling of traditional nonreal time transactions and soft real time transactions in this paper we study the concurrency control problems in mixed soft real time database systems in which both non real time and soft real time transactions exist simultaneously the objectives are to identify the cost and the performance tradeoff in the design of cost effective and practical real time concurrency control protocols and to evaluate their performance under different real time and non real time supports in particular we are interested in studying the impacts of different scheduling approaches for soft real time transactions on the performance of non real time transactions instead of proposing yet another completely new real time concurrency control protocol our objective is to design an efficient integrated concurrency control method based on existing techniques we propose several methods to integrate the well known two phase locking and optimistic concurrency control with the aims to meet the deadline requirements of soft real time transactions and at the same time to minimize the impact on the performance of non real time transactions we have conducted series of experiments based on sanitized version of stock trading systems to evaluate the performance of both soft real time and non real time transactions under different real time supports in the system

we present formal approach to implement fault tolerance in real time embedded systems the initial fault intolerant system consists of set of independent periodic tasks scheduled onto set of fail silent processors connected by reliable communication network we transform the tasks such that assuming the availability of an additional spare processor the system tolerates one failure at time transient or permanent failure detection is implemented using heartbeating and failure masking using checkpointing and rollback these techniques are described and implemented by automatic program transformations on the tasks programs the proposed formal approach to fault tolerance by program transformations highlights the benefits of separation of concerns it allows us to establish correctness properties and to compute optimal values of parameters to minimize fault tolerance overhead we also present an implementation of our method to demonstrate its feasibility and its efficiency
this paper describes kernel interface that provides an untrusted user level process an executive with protected access to memory management functions including the ability to create manipulate and execute within subservient contexts address spaces page motion callbacks not only give the executive limited control over physical memory management but also shift certain responsibilities out of the kernel greatly reducing kernel state and complexity the executive interface was motivated by the requirements of the wisconsin wind tunnel wwt system for evaluating cache coherent shared memory parallel architectures wwt uses the executive interface to implement fine grain user level extension of li's shared virtual memory on thinking machines cm message passing multicomputer however the interface is sufficiently general that an executive could act as multiprogrammed operating system exporting an alternative interface to the threads running in its subservient contexts the executive interface is currently implemented as an extension to cmost the standard operating system for the cm in cmost policy decisions are made on central distinct control processor cp and broadcast to the processing nodes pns the pns execute minimal kernel sufficient only to implement the cp's policy while this structure efficiently supports some parallel application models the lack of autonomy on the pns restricts its generality adding the executive interface provides limited autonomy to the pns creating structure that supports multiple models of application parallelism this structure with autonomy on top of centralization is in stark contrast to most microkernel based parallel operating systems in which the nodes are fundamentally autonomous
honeypot has been an invaluable tool for the detection and analysis of network based attacks by either human intruders or automated malware in the wild the insights obtained by deploying honeypots especially high interaction ones largely rely on the monitoring capability on the honeypots in practice based on the location of sensors honeypots can be monitored either internally or externally being deployed inside the monitored honeypots internal sensors are able to provide semantic rich view on various aspects of system dynamics eg system calls however their very internal existence makes them visible tangible and even subvertible to attackers after break ins from another perspective existing external honeypot sensors eg network sniffers could be made invisible to the monitored honeypot however they are not able to capture any internal system events such as system calls executed it is desirable to have honeypot monitoring system that is invisible tamper resistant and yet is capable of recording and understanding the honeypot's system internal events such as system calls in this paper we present virtualization based system called vmscope which allows us to view the system internal events of virtual machine vm based honeypots from outside the honeypots particularly by observing and interpreting vm internal system call events at the virtual machine monitor vmm layer vmscope is able to provide the same deep inspection capability as that of traditional inside the honeypot monitoring tools eg sebek while still obtaining similar tamper resistance and invisibility as other external monitoring tools we have built proof of concept prototype by leveraging and extending one key virtualization technique called binary translation our experiments with real world honeypots show that vmscope is robust against advanced countermeasures that can defeat existing internally deployed honeypot monitors and it only incurs moderate run time overhead
recently grids and pervasive systems have been drawing increasing attention in order to coordinate large scale resources enabling access to small and smart devices in this paper we propose caching approach enabling to improve querying on pervasive grids our proposal called semantic pervasive dual cache follows semantics oriented approach it is based on the one hand on clear separation between the analysis and the evaluation process and on the other hand on the cooperation between client caches considering light analysis and proxy caches including evaluation capabilities such an approach helps load balancing making the system more scalable we have validated semantic pervasive dual cache using analytic models and simulations results obtained show that our approach is quite promising
the algorithm selection problem rice seeks to answer the question which algorithm is likely to perform best for my problem quest recognizing the problem as learning task in the early the machine learning community has developed the field of meta learning focused on learning about learning algorithm performance on classification problems but there has been only limited generalization of these ideas beyond classification and many related attempts have been made in other disciplines such as ai and operations research to tackle the algorithm selection problem in different ways introducing different terminology and overlooking the similarities of approaches in this sense there is much to be gained from greater awareness of developments in meta learning and how these ideas can be generalized to learn about the behaviors of other nonlearning algorithms in this article we present unified framework for considering the algorithm selection problem as learning problem and use this framework to tie together the crossdisciplinary developments in tackling the algorithm selection problem we discuss the generalization of meta learning concepts to algorithms focused on tasks including sorting forecasting constraint satisfaction and optimization and the extension of these ideas to bioinformatics cryptography and other fields
behavior analysis of complex distributed systems has led to the search for enhanced reachability analysis techniques which support modularity and which control the state explosion problem while modularity has been achieved state explosion in still problem indeed this problem may even be exacerbated as locally minimized subsystem may contain many states and transitions forbidden by its environment or context context constraints specified as interface processes are restrictions imposed by the environment on subsystem behavior recent research has suggested that the state explosion problem can be effectively controlled if context constraints are incorporated in compositional reachability analysis cra although theoretically very promising the approach has rarely been used in practice because it generally requires more complex computational model and does not contain mechanism to derive context constraints automatically this article presents technique to automate the approach while using similar computational model to that of cra context constraints are derived automatically based on set of sufficient conditions for these constraints to be transparently included when building reachability graphs as result the global reachability graph generated using the derived constraints is shown to be observationally equivalent to that generated by cra without the inclusion of context constraints constraints can also be specified explicitly by users based on their application knowledge erroneous constraints which contravene transparency can be identified together with an indication of the error sources user specified constraints can be combined with those generated automatically the technique is illustrated using clients server system and other examples

we study the problem of querying xml data sources that accept only limited set of queries such as sources accessible by web services which can implement very large potentially infinite families of xpath queries to compactly specify such families of queries we adopt the query set specifications formalism close to context free grammars we say that query is expressible by the specification if it is equivalent to some expansion of is supported by if it has an equivalent rewriting using some finite set of p's expansions we study the complexity of expressibility and support and identify large classes of xpath queries for which there are efficient ptime algorithms our study considers both the case in which the xml nodes in the results of the queries lose their original identity and the one in which the source exposes persistent node ids
industry globalization brings with it inevitable changes to traditional organizational structures the notion of global virtual teams working together across geographical cultural and functional borders is becoming increasingly appealing this paper presents observations of how team of designers negotiate shared understanding in the collaborative design of virtual pedals for volvo car corporation although the team was globally distributed during most of the development process examples are drawn from collocated design sessions since this enables careful examination of the multifaceted ways in which collocated designers use wide variety of artifacts and techniques to create common ground the findings highlight the situational and interactional characteristics of design collaboration and suggest that the addition of shared objects to think with in distributed design environments could greatly facilitate global design teams in their collaborative process of thinking together apart
we consider the class of database programs and address the problem of minimizing the cost of their exchanges with the database server this cost partly consists of query execution at the server side and partly of query submission and network exchanges between the program and the server the natural organization of database programs leads to submit an intensive flow of elementary sql queries to the server and exploits only locally its optimization power in this paper we develop global optimization approach we base this approach on an execution model where queries can be executed asynchronously with respect to the flow of the application program our method aims at choosing an efficient query scheduling which limits the penalty of client server interactions our results show that the technique can improve the execution time of database programs by several orders of magnitude
both integer programming models and heuristic algorithms have been proposed for finding minimum energy broadcast and multicast trees in wireless ad hoc networks among heuristic algorithms the broadcast multicast incremental power bip mip algorithm is most known the theoretical performance of bip mip has been quantified in several studies to assess the empirical performance of bip mip and other heuristic algorithms it is necessary to compute an optimal tree or very good lower bound of the optimum in this paper we present an integer programming approach as well as improved heuristic algorithms our integer programming approach comprises novel integer model and relaxation scheme unlike previously proposed models the continuous relaxation of our model leads to very sharp lower bound of the optimum our relaxation scheme allows for performance evaluation of heuristics without having to compute optimal trees our contributions to heuristic algorithms consist of the power improving algorithm successive power adjustment spa and improved time complexity of some previously suggested algorithms we report extensive numerical experiments algorithm spa finds better solutions in comparison to host of other algorithms moreover the integer programming approach shows that trees found by algorithm spa are optimal or near optimal
the widespread deployment of sensor networks is on the horizon one of the main challenges in sensor networks is to process and aggregate data in the network rather than wasting energy by sending large amounts of raw data to reply to query some efficient data dissemination methods particularly data centric storage and information aggregation rely on efficient routing from one node to another in this paper we introduce gem graph embedding for sensor networks an infrastructure for node to node routing and data centric storage and information processing in sensor networks unlike previous approaches it does not depend on geographic information and it works well even in the face of physical obstacles in gem we construct labeled graph that can be embedded in the original network topology in an efficient and distributed fashion in that graph each node is given label that encodes its position in the original network topology this allows messages to be efficiently routed through the network while each node only needs to know the labels of its neighborsto demonstrate how gem can be applied we have developed concrete graph embedding method vpcs virtual polar coordinate space in vpcs we embed ringed tree into the network topology and label the nodes in such manner as to create virtual polar coordinate space we have also developed vpcr an efficient routing algorithm that uses vpcs vpcr is the first algorithm for node to node routing that guarantees reachability requires each node to keep state only about its immediate neighbors and requires no geographic information our simulation results show that vpcr is robust on dynamic networks works well in the face of voids and obstacles and scales well with network size and density

while static typing is widely accepted as being necessary for secure program execution dynamic typing is also viewed as being essential in some applications particularly for distributed programming environments dynamics have been proposed as language construct for dynamic typing based on experience with languages such as clu cedar mesa and modula however proposals for incorporating dynamic typing into languages with parametric polymorphism have serious shortcomings new approach is presented to extending polymorphic lnanguages with dynamic typing at the heart of the approach is the use of dynamic type dispatch where polymorphic functions may analyze the structure of their type arguments this approach solves several open problems with the traditional approach to adding dynamic typing to polymorphic languages an explicity typed language xmldyn is presented this language uses refinement kinds to ensure that dynamic type dispatch does not fail at run time safe dynamics are new form of dynamics that use refinement kinds to statically check the use of run time dynamic typing run time errors are isolated to separate construct for performing run time type checks

the widespread adoption of xml holds out the promise that document structure can be exploited to specify precise database queries however the user may have only limited knowledge of the xml structure and hence may be unable to produce correct xquery especially in the context of heterogeneous information collection the default is to use keyword based search and we are all too familiar with how difficult it is to obtain precise answers by these means we seek to address these problems by introducing the notion of meaningful lowest common ancestor structure mlcas for finding related nodes within an xml document by automatically computing mlcas and expanding ambiguous tag names we add new functionality to xquery and enable users to take full advantage of xquery in querying xml data precisely and efficiently without requiring perfect knowledge of the document structure such schema free xquery is potentially of value not just to casual users with partial knowledge of schema but also to experts working in data integration or data evolution context in such context schema free query once written can be applied universally to multiple data sources that supply similar content under different schemas and applied forever as these schemas evolve our experimental evaluation found that it was possible to express wide variety of queries in schema free manner and have them return correct results over broad diversity of schemas furthermore the evaluation of schema free query is not expensive using novel stack based algorithm we develop for computing mlcas from to times the execution time of an equivalent schema aware query

we study the problem of finding efficient equivalent view based rewritings of relational queries focusing on query optimization using materialized views under the assumption that base relations cannot contain duplicate tuples lot of work in the literature addresses the problems of answering queries using views and query optimization however most of it proposes solutions for special cases such as for conjunctive queries cqs or for aggregate queries only in addition most of it addresses the problems separately under set or bag set semantics for query evaluation and some of it proposes heuristics without formal proofs for completeness or soundness in this paper we look at the two problems by considering cq queries that is both pure conjunctive and aggregate queries with aggregation functions sum count min and max the distinct keyword in sql versions of our queries is also allowed we build on past work to provide algorithms that handle this general setting this is possible because recent results on rewritings of cq queries show that there are sound and complete algorithms based on containment tests of cqsour focus is that our algorithms are efficient as well as sound and complete besides the contribution we make in putting and addressing the problems in this general setting we make two additional contributions for bag set and set semantics first we propose efficient sound and complete tests for equivalence of cq queries to rewritings that use overlapping views the algorithms are complete with respect to the language of rewritings these results apply not only to query optimization but to all areas where the goal is to obtain efficient equivalent view based query rewritings second based on these results we propose two sound algorithms bdpv and cdpv that find efficient execution plans for cq queries in terms of materialized views both algorithms extend the cost based query optimization approach of system the efficient sound algorithm bdpv is also complete in some cases whereas cdpv is sound and complete for all cq queries we consider we present study of the completeness efficiency tradeoff in the algorithms and provide experimental results that show the viability of our approach and test the limits of query optimization using overlapping views
this paper addresses the problem of resolving virtual method and interface calls in java bytecode the main focus is on new practical technique that can be used to analyze large applications our fundamental design goal was to develop technique that can be solved with only one iteration and thus scales linearly with the size of the program while at the same time providing more accurate results than two popular existing linear techniques class hierarchy analysis and rapid type analysiswe present two variations of our new technique variable type analysis and coarser grain version called declared type analysis both of these analyses are inexpensive easy to implement and our experimental results show that they scale linearly in the size of the programwe have implemented our new analyses using the soot frame work and we report on empirical results for seven benchmarks we have used our techniques to build accurate call graphs for complete applications including libraries and we show that compared to conservative call graph built using class hierarchy analysis our new variable type analysis can remove significant number of nodes methods and call edges further our results show that we can improve upon the compression obtained using rapid type analysiswe also provide dynamic measurements of monomorphic call sites focusing on the benchmark code excluding libraries we demonstrate that when considering only the benchmark code both rapid type analysis and our new declared type analysis do not add much precision over class hierarchy analysis however our finer grained variable type analysis does resolve significantly more call sites particularly for programs with more complex uses of objects
software model checkers are typically language specific require substantial development efforts and are hard to reuse for other languages adding partial order reduction por capabilities to such tools typically requires sophisticated changes to the tool's model checking algorithms this paper proposes new method to make software model checkers language independent and improving their performance through por getting the por capabilities does not require making any changes to the underlying model checking algorithms for each language they are instead achieved through theory transformationr of l's formal semantics rewrite theory under very minimal assumptions this can be done for any language with relatively little effort our experiments with the jvm promela like language and maude indicate that significant state space reductions and time speedups can be gained for tools generated this way
database sharing db sharing refers to general approach for building distributed high performance transaction system the nodes of db sharing system are locally coupled via high speed interconnect and share common database at the disk level this is also known as ldquo shared disk rdquo approach we compare database sharing with the database partitioning shared nothing approach and discuss the functional dbms components that require new and coordinated solutions for db sharing the performance of db sharing systems critically depends on the protocols used for concurrency and coherency control the frequency of communication required for these functions has to be kept as low as possible in order to achieve high transation rates and short response times trace driven simulation system for db sharing complexes has been developed that allows realistic performance comparison of four different concurrency and coherency control protocols we consider two locking and two optimistic schemes which operate either under central or distributed control for coherency control we investigate so called on request and broadcast invalidation schemes and employ buffer to buffer communication to exchange modified pages directly between different nodes the performance impact of random routing versus affinity based load distribution and different communication costs is also examined in addition we analyze potential performance bottlenecks created by hot spot pages
an important goal of an operating system is to make computing and communication resources available in fair and efficient way to the applications that will run on top of it to achieve this result the operating system implements number of policies for allocating resources to and sharing resources among applications and it implements safety mechanisms to guard against misbehaving applications however for most of these allocation and sharing tasks no single optimal policy exists different applications may prefer different operating system policies to achieve their goals in the best possible way customizable or adaptable operating system is an operating system that allows for flexible modification of important system policies over the past decade wide range of approaches for achieving customizability has been explored in the operating systems research community in this survey an overview of these approaches structured around taxonomy is presented
this paper explores the use of resolution as meta framework for developing various different deduction calculi in this work the focus is on developing deduction calculi for modal dynamic logics dynamic modal logics are pdl like extended modal logics which are closely related to description logics we show how tableau systems modal resolution systems and rasiowa sikorski systems can be developed and studied by using standard principles and methods of first order theorem proving the approach is based on the translation of reasoning problems in modal logic to first order clausal form and using suitable refinement of resolution to construct and mimic derivations of the desired proof method the inference rules of the calculus can then be read off from the clausal form we show how this approach can be used to generate new proof calculi and prove soundness completeness and decidability results this slightly unusual approach allows us to gain new insights and results for familiar and less familiar logics for different proof methods and compare them not only theoretically but also empirically in uniform framework
geometry processing algorithms have traditionally assumed that the input data is entirely in main memory and available for random access this assumption does not scale to large data sets as exhausting the physical memory typically leads to io inefficient thrashing recent works advocate processing geometry in streaming manner where computation and output begin as soon as possible streaming is suitable for tasks that require only local neighbor information and batch process an entire data setwe describe streaming compression scheme for tetrahedral volume meshes that encodes vertices and tetrahedra in the order they are written to keep the memory footprint low the compressor is informed when vertices are referenced for the last time ie are finalized the compression achieved depends on how coherent the input order is and how many tetrahedra are buffered for local reordering for reasonably coherent orderings and buffer of tetrahedra we achieve compression rates that are only to percent above the state of the art while requiring drastically less memory resources and less than half the processing time
it is well known that query is an approximate representation of the user's information needs since it does not provide sufficient specification of the attended results numerous studies addressed this issue using techniques for better eliciting either document or query representations more recent studies investigated the use of search context to better understand the user intent driven by the query in order to deliver personalized information results in this article we propose personalized information retrieval model that leverages the information relevance by its usefulness to both the query and the user's profile expressed by his main topics of interest the model is based on the influence diagram formalism which is an extension of bayesian networks dedicated to decision problems this graphical model offers an intuitive way to represent in the same framework all the basic information terms documents user interests surrounding the user's information need and also quantify their mutual influence on the relevance estimation experimental results demonstrate that our model was successful at eliciting user queries according to dynamic changes of the user interests
this paper presents pioneer vliw architecture of native java processor we show that thanks to the specific stack architecture and to the use of the vliw technique one is able to obtain meaningful reduction of power dissipation with small area overhead when compared to other ways of executing java in hardware the underlying technique is based on the reuse of memory access instructions hence reducing power during memory or cache accesses the architecture is validated for some complex embedded applications like imdct computation and other data processing benchmarks
in the maximum constraint satisfaction problem max csp one is given finite collection of possibly weighted constraints on overlapping sets of variables and the goal is to assign values from given finite domain to the variables so as to maximize the number or the total weight for the weighted case of satisfied constraints this problem is np hard in general and therefore it is natural to study how restricting the allowed types of constraints affects the approximability of the problem in this article we show that any max csp problem with finite set of allowed constraint types which includes all fixed value constraints ie constraints of the form equals is either solvable exactly in polynomial time or else is apx complete even if the number of occurrences of variables in instances is bounded moreover we present simple description of all polynomial time solvable cases of our problem this description relies on the well known algebraic combinatorial property of supermodularity
test suite minimization techniques aim to eliminate redundant test cases from test suite based on some criteria such as coverage or fault detection capability most existing test suite minimization techniques have two main limitations they perform minimization based on single criterion and produce suboptimal solutions in this paper we propose test suite minimization framework that overcomes these limitations by allowing testers to easily encode wide spectrum of test suite minimization problems handle problems that involve any number of criteria and compute optimal solutions by leveraging modern integer linear programming solvers we implemented our framework in tool called mints that is freely available and can be interfaced with number of different state of the art solvers our empirical evaluation shows that mints can be used to instantiate number of different test suite minimization problems and efficiently find an optimal solution for such problems using different solvers
in this paper the authors share their experiences gathered during the design and implementation of the corba persistent object service there are two problems related to design and implementation of the persistence service first omg intentionally leaves the functionality core of the persistence service unspecified second omg encourages reuse of other object services without being specific enough in this respect the paper identifies the key design issues implied both by the intentional lack of omg specification and the limits of the implementation environment characteristics at the same time the paper discusses the benefits and drawbacks of reusing other object services particularly the relationship and externalization services to support the persistence service surprisingly the key lesson learned is that direct reuse of these object services is impossible
human communication involves not only speech but also wide variety of gestures and body motions interactions in virtual environments often lack this multi modal aspect of communication we present method for automatically synthesizing body language animations directly from the participants speech signals without the need for additional input our system generates appropriate body language animations by selecting segments from motion capture data of real people in conversation the synthesis can be performed progressively with no advance knowledge of the utterance making the system suitable for animating characters from live human speech the selection is driven by hidden markov model and uses prosody based features extracted from speech the training phase is fully automatic and does not require hand labeling of input data and the synthesis phase is efficient enough to run in real time on live microphone input user studies confirm that our method is able to produce realistic and compelling body language
software change resulting from new requirements environmental modifications and error detection creates numerous challenges for the maintenance of software products while many software evolution strategies focus on code to modeling language analysis few address software evolution at higher abstraction levels most lack the flexibility to incorporate multiple modeling languages not many consider the integration and reuse of domain knowledge with design knowledge we address these challenges by combining ontologies and model weaving to assist in software evolution of abstract artifacts our goals are to recover high level artifacts such as requirements and design models defined using variety of software modeling languages simplify modification of those models reuse software design and domain knowledge contained within models and integrate those models with enhancements via novel combination of ontological and model weaving concepts additional benefits to design recovery and software evolution include detecting high level dependencies and identifying differences between evolved software and initial specifications
collaborative filtering recommender systems are typically unable to generate adequate recommendations for newcomers empirical evidence suggests that the incorporation of trust network among the users of recommender system can significantly help to alleviate this problem hence users are highly encouraged to connect to other users to expand the trust network but choosing whom to connect to is often difficult task given the impact this choice has on the delivered recommendations it is critical to guide newcomers through this early stage connection process in this paper we identify several classes of key figures in the trust network namely mavens frequent raters and connectors furthermore we introduce measures to assess the influence of these users on the amount and the quality of the recommendations delivered by trust enhanced collaborative filtering recommender system experiments on dataset from epinionscom support the claim that generated recommendations for new users are more beneficial if they connect to an identified key figure compared to random user
fault tolerance in distributed computing is wide area with significant body of literature that is vastly diverse in methodology and terminology this paper aims at structuring the area and thus guiding readers into this interesting field we use formal approach to define important terms like fault fault tolerance and redundancy this leads to four distinct forms of fault tolerance and to two main phases in achieving them detection and correction we show that this can help to reveal inherently fundamental structures that contribute to understanding and unifying methods and terminology by doing this we survey many existing methodologies and discuss their relations the underlying system model is the close to reality asynchronous message passing model of distributed computing
cache misses due to coherence actions are often the major source for performance degradation in cache coherent multiprocessors it is often difficult for the programmer to take cache coherence into account when writing the program since the resulting access pattern is not apparent until the program is executedsm prof is performance analysis tool that addresses this problem by visualising the shared data access pattern in diagram with links to the source code lines causing performance degrading access patterns the execution of program is divided into time slots and each data block is classified based on the accesses made to the block during time slot this enables the programmer to follow the execution over time and it is possible to track the exact position responsible for accesses causing many cache misses related to coherence actionsmatrix multiplication and the mpd application from splash are used to illustrate the use of sm prof for mpd sm prof revealed performance limitations that resulted in performance improvement of over the current implementation is based on program driven simulation in order to achieve non intrusive profiling if small perturbation of the program execution is acceptable it is also possible to use software tracing techniques given that data address can be related to the originating instruction
many web sites have begun allowing users to submit items to collection and tag them with keywords the folksonomies built from these tags are an interesting topic that has seen little empirical research this study compared the search information retrieval ir performance of folksonomies from social bookmarking web sites against search engines and subject directories thirty four participants created queries for various information needs results from each ir system were collected and participants judged relevance folksonomy search results overlapped with those from the other systems and documents found by both search engines and folksonomies were significantly more likely to be judged relevant than those returned by any single ir system type the search engines in the study had the highest precision and recall but the folksonomies fared surprisingly well delicious was statistically indistinguishable from the directories in many cases overall the directories were more precise than the folksonomies but they had similar recall scores better query handling may enhance folksonomy ir performance further the folksonomies studied were promising and may be able to improve web search performance
the emergence of mobile computing provides the ability to access information at any time and place however as mobile computing environments have inherent factors like power storage asymmetric communication cost and bandwidth limitations efficient query processing and minimum query response time are definitely of great interest this survey groups variety of query optimization and processing mechanisms in mobile databases into two main categories namely query processing strategy and ii caching management strategy query processing includes both pull and push operations broadcast mechanisms we further classify push operation into on demand broadcast and periodic broadcast push operation on demand broadcast relates to designing techniques that enable the server to accommodate multiple requests so that the request can be processed efficiently push operation periodic broadcast corresponds to data dissemination strategies in this scheme several techniques to improve the query performance by broadcasting data to population of mobile users are described caching management strategy defines number of methods for maintaining cached data items in clients local storage this strategy considers critical caching issues such as caching granularity caching coherence strategy and caching replacement policy finally this survey concludes with several open issues relating to mobile query optimization and processing strategy
kernel functions have become an extremely popular tool in machine learning with an attractive theory as well this theory views kernel as implicitly mapping data points into possibly very high dimensional space and describes kernel function as being good for given learning problem if data is separable by large margin in that implicit space however while quite elegant this theory does not necessarily correspond to the intuition of good kernel as good measure of similarity and the underlying margin in the implicit space usually is not apparent in natural representations of the data therefore it may be difficult for domain expert to use the theory to help design an appropriate kernel for the learning task at hand moreover the requirement of positive semi definiteness may rule out the most natural pairwise similarity functions for the given problem domainin this work we develop an alternative more general theory of learning with similarity functions ie sufficient conditions for similarity function to allow one to learn well that does not require reference to implicit spaces and does not require the function to be positive semi definite or even symmetric instead our theory talks in terms of more direct properties of how the function behaves as similarity measure our results also generalize the standard theory in the sense that any good kernel function under the usual definition can be shown to also be good similarity function under our definition though with some loss in the parameters in this way we provide the first steps towards theory of kernels and more general similarity functions that describes the effectiveness of given function in terms of natural similarity based properties
safety and security are top concerns in maritime navigation particularly as maritime traffic continues to grow and as crew sizes are reduced the automatic identification system ais plays key role in regard to these concerns this system whose objective is in part to identify and locate vessels transmits location related information from vessels to ground stations that are part of so called vessel traffic service vts thus enabling these to track the movements of the vessels this paper presents techniques that improve the existing ais by offering better and guaranteed tracking accuracies at lower communication costs the techniques employ movement predictions that are shared between vessels and the vts empirical studies with prototype implementation and real vessel data demonstrate that the techniques are capable of significantly improving the ais
mature knowledge allows engineering disciplines the achievement of predictable results unfortunately the type of knowledge used in software engineering can be considered to be of relatively low maturity and developers are guided by intuition fashion or market speak rather than by facts or undisputed statements proper to an engineering discipline testing techniques determine different criteria for selecting the test cases that will be used as input to the system under examination which means that an effective and efficient selection of test cases conditions the success of the tests the knowledge for selecting testing techniques should come from studies that empirically justify the benefits and application conditions of the different techniques this paper analyzes the maturity level of the knowledge about testing techniques by examining existing empirical studies about these techniques we have analyzed their results and obtained testing technique knowledge classification based on their factuality and objectivity according to four parameters
designing and implementing system software so that it scales well on shared memory multiprocessors smmps has proven to be surprisingly challenging to improve scalability most designers to date have focused on concurrency by iteratively eliminating the need for locks and reducing lock contention however our experience indicates that locality is just as if not more important and that focusing on locality ultimately leads to more scalable system in this paper we describe methodology and framework for constructing system software structured for locality exploiting techniques similar to those used in distributed systems specifically we found two techniques to be effective in improving scalability of smmp operating systems an object oriented structure that minimizes sharing by providing natural mapping from independent requests to independent code paths and data structures and ii the selective partitioning distribution and replication of object implementations in order to improve locality we describe concrete examples of distributed objects and our experience implementing them we demonstrate that the distributed implementations improve the scalability of operating system intensive parallel workloads
memory based collaborative filtering cf makes recommendations based on collection of user preferences for items the idea underlying this approach is that the interests of an active user will more likely coincide with those of users who share similar preferences to the active user hence the choice and computation of similarity measure between users is critical to rating items this work proposes similarity update method that uses an iterative message passing procedure additionally this work deals with drawback of using the popular mean absolute error mae for performance evaluation namely that ignores ratings distribution novel modulation method and an accuracy metric are presented in order to minimize the predictive accuracy error and to evenly distribute predicted ratings over true rating scales preliminary results show that the proposed similarity update and prediction modulation techniques significantly improve the predicted rankings
many empirical studies have found that software metrics can predict class error proneness and the prediction can be used to accurately group error prone classes recent empirical studies have used open source systems these studies however focused on the relationship between software metrics and class error proneness during the development phase of software projects whether software metrics can still predict class error proneness in system's post release evolution is still question to be answered this study examined three releases of the eclipse project and found that although some metrics can still predict class error proneness in three error severity categories the accuracy of the prediction decreased from release to release furthermore we found that the prediction cannot be used to build metrics model to identify error prone classes with acceptable accuracy these findings suggest that as system evolves the use of some commonly used metrics to identify which classes are more prone to errors becomes increasingly difficult and we should seek alternative methods to the metric prediction models to locate error prone classes if we want high accuracy
recently with the broad usage of location aware devices applications with moving object management become very popular in order to manage moving objects efficiently many spatial spatial temporal data access methods have been proposed however most of these data access methods are designed for single user environments in multiple user systems frequent updates may cause significant number of read write conflicts using these data access methods in this paper we propose an efficient framework concurrent location management clam for managing moving objects in multiple user environments the proposed concurrency control protocol integrates the efficiency of the link based approach and the flexibility of the lock coupling mechanism based on this protocol concurrent location update and search algorithms are provided we formally analyze and prove the correctness of the proposed concurrent operations experiment results on real datasets validate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed concurrent location management framework
novel adaptive trust based anonymous network atan is proposed the distributed and decentralised network management in atan does not require central authority so that atan alleviates the problem of single point of failure in some existing anonymous networks packets are routed onto intermediate nodes anonymously without knowing whether these nodes are trustworthy on the other hand an intermediate node should ensure that packets which it forwards are not malicious and it will not be allegedly accused of involving in the attack to meet these objectives the intermediate node only forwards packets received from the trusted predecessor which can be either the source or another intermediate node in atan our trust and reputation model aims to enhance anonymity by establishing trust and reputation relationship between the source and the forwarding members the trust and reputation relationship of any two nodes is adaptive to new information learned by these two nodes or recommended from other trust nodes therefore packets are anonymously routed from the trusted source to the destination through trusted intermediate nodes thereby improving anonymity of communications
it is time honored fashion to implement domain specific language dsl by translation to general purpose language such an implementation is more portable but an unidiomatic translation jeopardizes performance because in practice language implementations favor the common cases this tension arises especially when the domain calls for complex control structures we illustrate this tension by revisiting landin's original correspondence between algol and church's lambda notationwe translate domain specific programs with lexically scoped jumps to javascript our translation produces the same block structure and binding structure as in the source program la abdali the target code uses control operator in direct style la landin in fact the control operator used is almost landin's hence our title our translation thus complements continuation passing translation la steele these two extreme translations require javascript implementations to cater either for first class continuations as rhino does or for proper tail recursion less extreme translations should emit more idiomatic control flow instructions such as for break and throwthe present experiment leads us to conclude that translations should preserve not just the data structures and the block structure of source program but also its control structure we thus identify new class of use cases for control structures in javascript namely the idiomatic translation of control structures from dsls

group comparison per se is fundamental task in many scientific endeavours but is also the basis of any classifier contrast sets and emerging patterns contrast between groups of categorical data comparing groups of sequence data is relevant task in many applications we define emerging sequences ess as subsequences that are frequent in sequences of one group and less frequent in the sequences of another and thus distinguishing or contrasting sequences of different classes there are two challenges to distinguish sequence classes the extraction of ess is not trivially efficient and only exact matches of sequences are considered in our work we address those problems by suffix tree based framework and similar matching mechanism we propose classifier based on emerging sequences evaluating against two learning algorithms based on frequent subsequences and exact matching subsequences the experiments on two datasets show that our model outperforms the baseline approaches by up to in prediction accuracy

chip multi processor cmp architectures have become mainstream for designing processors with large number of cores networks on chip nocs provide scalable communication method for cmp architectures nocs must be carefully designed to meet constraints of power consumption and area and provide ultra low latencies existing nocs mostly use dimension order routing dor to determine the route taken by packet in unicast traffic however with the development of diverse applications in cmps one to many multicast and one to all broadcast traffic are becoming more common current unicast routing cannot support multicast and broadcast traffic efficiently in this paper we propose recursive partitioning multicast rpm routing and detailed multicast wormhole router design for nocs rpm allows routers to select intermediate replication nodes based on the global distribution of destination nodes this provides more path diversities thus achieves more bandwidth efficiency and finally improves the performance of the whole network our simulation results using detailed cycle accurate simulator show that compared with the most recent multicast scheme rpm saves of crossbar and link power and of link utilization with network performance improvement also rpm is more scalable to large networks than the recently proposed vctm
in this paper we proposed an efficient and accurate text chunking system using linear svm kernel and new technique called masked method previous researches indicated that systems combination or external parsers can enhance the chunking performance however the cost of constructing multi classifiers is even higher than developing single processor moreover the use of external resources will complicate the original tagging process to remedy these problems we employ richer features and propose masked based method to solve unknown word problem to enhance system performance in this way no external resources or complex heuristics are required for the chunking system the experiments show that when training with the conll chunking dataset our system achieves in rate with linear furthermore our chunker is quite efficient since it adopts linear kernel svm the turn around tagging time on conll testing data is less than which is about times than polynomial kernel svm
type systems for secure information flow are useful for efficiently checking that programs have secure information flow they are however conservative so that they often reject safe programs as ill typed accordingly users have to check whether the rejected programs indeed have insecure flows to remedy this problem we propose method for automatically finding counterexample of secure information flow input states that actually lead to leakage of secret information our method is novel combination of type based analysis and model checking suspicious execution paths that may cause insecure information flow are first found by using the result of type based information flow analysis and then model checker is used to check whether the paths are indeed unsafe we have formalized and implemented the method the result of preliminary experiments shows that our method can often find counterexamples faster than method using model checker alone
linear constraint databases and query languages are appropriate for spatial database applications not only is the data model suitable for representing large portion of spatial data such as in gis systems but there also exist efficient algorithms for the core operations in the query languages an important limitation of linear constraints however is that they cannot model constructs such as euclidean distance extending such languages to include such constructs without obtaining the full power of polynomial constraints has proven to be quite difficult one approach to this problem by kuijpers kuper paredaens and vandeurzen used the notion of euclidean constructions with ruler and compass as the basis for first order query language while their language had the desired expressive power the semantics are not really natural due to its use of an ad hoc encoding in this paper we define language over similar class of databases with more natural semantics we show that this language captures natural subclass the representation independent queries of the first order language of kuijpers kuper paredaens and vandeurzen

many tasks require attention switching for example searching for information on one sheet of paper and then entering this information onto another one with paper we see that people use fingers or objects as placeholders using these simple aids the process of switching attention between displays can be simplified and speeded up with large or multiple visual displays we have many tasks where both attention areas are on the screen and where using finger as placeholder is not suitable one way users deal with this is to use the mouse and highlight their current focus however this also has its limitations in particular in environments where there is no pointing device our approach is to utilize the user's gaze position to provide visual placeholder the last area where user fixated on the screen before moving their attention away is highlighted we call this visual reminder gazemark gazemarks ease orientation and the resumption of the interrupted task when coming back to this display in this paper we report on study where the effectiveness of using gazemarks was investigated in particular we show how they can ease attention switching our results show faster completion times for resumed simple visual search task when using this technique the paper analyzes relevant parameters for the implementation of gazemarks and discusses some further application areas for this approach

we consider ad hoc radio networks in which each node knows only its own identity but is unaware of the topology of the network or of any bound on its size or diameter acknowledged broadcasting ab is communication task consisting in transmitting message from distinguished source to all other nodes of the network and making this fact common knowledge among all nodes to do this the underlying directed graph must be strongly connected working in model allowing all nodes to transmit spontaneously even before getting the source message chlebus et al chlebus ga sieniec gibbons pelc rytter deterministic broadcasting in unknown radio networks distrib comput proved that ab is impossible if collision detection is not available and gave an ab algorithm using collision detection that works in time nd where is the number of nodes and is the eccentricity of the source uchida et al uchida chen wada acknowledged broadcasting and gossiping in ad hoc radio networks theoret comput sci showed an ab algorithm without collision detection working in time log for all strongly connected networks of size at least in particular it follows that the impossibility result from chlebus ga sieniec gibbons pelc rytter deterministic broadcasting in unknown radio networks distrib comput is really caused by the singleton network for which ab amounts to realize that the source is alone we improve those two results by presenting two generic ab algorithms using broadcasting algorithm without acknowledgement as procedure for large class of broadcasting algorithms the resulting ab algorithm has the same time complexity using the currently best known broadcasting algorithms we obtain an ab algorithm with collision detection working in time min nlog nlognloglogn for arbitrary strongly connected networks and an ab algorithm without collision detection working in time nlognloglogn for all strongly connected networks of size moreover we show that in the model in which only nodes that already got the source message can transmit ab is infeasible in strong sense for any ab algorithm there exists an infinite family of networks for which this algorithm is incorrect
spoken language generation for dialogue systems requires dictionary of mappings between the semantic representations of concepts that the system wants to express and the realizations of those concepts dictionary creation is costly process it is currently done by hand for each dialogue domain we propose novel unsupervised method for learning such mappings from user reviews in the target domain and test it in the restaurant and hotel domains experimental results show that the acquired mappings achieve high consistency between the semantic representation and the realization and that the naturalness of the realization is significantly higher than the baseline
in this paper we propose mobile terminal mt location registration update model in this model the registration decision is based on two factors the time elapsed since last call arrival and the distance the mt has traveled since last registration it is established that the optimal registration strategy can be represented by curve only when the state of the system reaches this curve is registration performed in order for an mt to calculate its traveled distance an interactive implementation scheme and distance calculation algorithm are developed when the call interarrival times are independent and geometrically distributed the proposed model becomes distance based model and in this case the optimal registration strategy is of threshold structure for the distance based model single sample path based ordinal optimization algorithm is devised in this algorithm without any knowledge about the system parameters the mt observes the system state transitions estimates the ordinal of set of strategies and updates the registration strategy adaptively since only single sample path is used this algorithm can be implemented online several numerical examples are provided to compare the proposed model and the existing ones
in mobile and wireless environments mobile clients can access information with respect to their locations by submitting location dependent spatial queries ldsqs to location based service lbs servers owing to scarce wireless channel bandwidth and limited client battery life frequent ldsq submission from clients must be avoided observing that ldsqs issued from similar client positions would normally return the same results we explore the idea of valid scope that represents spatial area in which set of ldsqs will retrieve exactly the same query results with valid scope derived and an ldsq result cached at the client side client can assert whether the new ldsqs can be answered with the maintained ldsq result thus eliminating the ldsqs sent to the server as such contention on wireless channel and client energy consumed for data transmission can be considerably reduced in this paper we design efficient algorithms to compute the valid scope for common types of ldsqs including nearest neighbor queries and range queries through an extensive set of experiments our proposed valid scope computation algorithms are shown to significantly outperform existing approaches

in this paper we propose memory reduction as new approach to data locality enhancement under this approach we use the compiler to reduce the size of the data repeatedly referenced in collection of nested loops between their reuses the data will more likely remain in higher speed memory devices such as the cache specifically we present an optimal algorithm to combine loop shifting loop fusion and array contraction to reduce the temporary array storage required to execute collection of loops when applied to benchmark programs our technique reduces the memory requirement counting both the data and the code by on average the transformed programs gain speedup of on average due to the reduced footprint and consequently the improved data locality
domain model which captures the common knowledge and the possible variability allowed among applications in domain may assist in the creation of other valid applications in that domain however to create such domain models is not trivial task it requires expertise in the domain reaching very high level of abstraction and providing flexible yet formal artifacts in this paper an approach called semi automated domain modeling sdm to create draft domain models from applications in those domains is presented sdm takes repository of application models in domain and matches merges and generalizes them into sound draft domain models that include the commonality and variability allowed in these domains the similarity of the different elements is measured with consideration of syntactic semantic and structural aspects unlike ontology and schema integration these models capture both structural and behavioral aspects of the domain running sdm on small repositories of project management applications and scheduling systems we found that the approach may provide reasonable draft domain models whose comprehensibility correctness completeness and consistency levels are satisfactory
this paper tackles the problem of structural integration testing of stateful classes previous work on structural testing of objectoriented software exploits data flow analysis to derive test requirements for class testing and defines contextual def use associations to characterize inter method relations non contextual data flow testing of classes works well for unit testing but not for integration testing since it misses definitions and uses when properly encapsulated contextual data flow analysis approaches investigated so far either do not focus on state dependent behavior or have limited applicability due to high complexity this paper proposes an efficient structural technique based on contextual data flow analysis to test state dependent behavior of classes that aggregate other classes as part of their state
the augmented graph model as introduced in kleinberg stoc is an appealing model for analyzing navigability in social networks informally this model is defined by pair where is graph in which inter node distances are supposed to be easy to compute or at least easy to estimate this graph is augmented by links called long range links that are selected according to the probability distribution the augmented graph model enables the analysis of greedy routing in augmented graphs in greedy routing each intermediate node handling message for target selects among all its neighbors in the one that is the closest to in and forwards the message to it this paper addresses the problem of checking whether given graph is an augmented graph it answers part of the questions raised by kleinberg in his problem int congress of math more precisely given we aim at extracting the base graph and the long range links out of we prove that if has high clustering coefficient and has bounded doubling dimension then simple local maximum likelihood algorithm enables us to partition the edges of into two sets and such that and the edges in are of small stretch ie the map is not perturbed too greatly by undetected long range links remaining in the perturbation is actually so small that we can prove that the expected performances of greedy routing in using the distances in are close to the expected performances of greedy routing using the distances in although this latter result may appear intuitively straightforward since it is not as we also show that routing with map more precise than may actually damage greedy routing significantly finally we show that in the absence of hypothesis regarding the high clustering coefficient any local maximum likelihood algorithm extracting the long range links can miss the detection of logn long range links of stretch for any
we propose novel algorithm terminated ramp support vector machines tr svm for classification and feature ranking purposes in the family of support vector machines the main improvement relies on the fact that the kernel is automatically determined by the training examples it is built as function of simple classifiers generalized terminated ramp functions obtained by separating oppositely labeled pairs of training points the algorithm has meaningful geometrical interpretation and it is derived in the framework of tikhonov regularization theory its unique free parameter is the regularization one representing trade off between empirical error and solution complexity employing the equivalence between the proposed algorithm and two layer networks theoretical bound on the generalization error is also derived together with vapnik chervonenkis dimension performances are tested on number of synthetic and real data sets
verifying properties of large real world programs requires vast quantities of information on aspects such as procedural contexts loop invariants or pointer aliasing it is unimaginable to have all these properties provided to verification tool by annotations from the user static analysis will clearly play key role in the design of future verification engines by automatically discovering the bulk of this information the body of research in static program analysis can be split up in two major areas one probably the larger in terms of publications is concerned with discovering properties of data structures shape analysis pointer analysis the other addresses the inference of numerical invariants for integer or floating point algorithms range analysis propagation of round off errors in numerical algorithms we will call the former symbolic static analysis and the latter numerical static analysis both areas were successful in effectively analyzing large applications however symbolic and numerical static analysis are commonly regarded as entirely orthogonal problems for example pointer analysis usually abstracts away all numerical values that appear in the program whereas the floating point analysis tool astree does not abstract memory at all
in mobile computing environment database servers disseminate information to multiple mobile clients via wireless channels due to the low bandwidth and low reliability of wireless channels it is important for mobile client to cache its frequently accessed database items into its local storage this improves performance of database queries and improves availability of database items for query processing during disconnection in this paper we investigate issues on caching granularity coherence strategy and replacement policy of caching mechanisms for mobile environment utilizing point to point communication paradigmwe first illustrate that page based caching is not suitable in the mobile context due to the lack of locality among database items we propose three different levels of caching granularity attribute caching object caching and hybrid caching hybrid approach of attribute and object caching next we show that existing coherence strategies are inappropriate due to frequent disconnection in mobile environment and propose cache coherence strategy based on the update patterns of database items via detail simulation model we examine the performance of various levels of caching granularity with our cache coherence strategy we observe in general that hybrid caching could achieve better performance finally we propose several cache replacement policies that can adapt to the access patterns of database items for each given caching granularity we discover that our replacement policies outperform conventional ones in most situations

the paper considers the consensus problem in partially synchronous system with byzantine processes in this context the literature distinguishes authenticated byzantine faults where messages can be signed by the sending process with the assumption that the signature cannot be forged by any other process and byzantine faults where there is no mechanism for signatures but the receiver of message knows the identity of the sender the paper proposes an abstraction called weak interactive consistency wic that unifies consensus algorithms with and without signed messages wic can be implemented with and without signaturesthe power of wic is illustrated on two seminal byzantine consensus algorithms the castro liskov pbft algorithm no signatures and the martin alvisi fab paxos algorithms signatures wic allows very concise expression of these two algorithms
we present novel algorithms that optimize the order in which triangles are rendered to improve post transform vertex cache efficiency as well as for view independent overdraw reduction the resulting triangle orders perform on par with previous methods but are orders magnitude faster to compute the improvements in processing speed allow us to perform the optimization right after model is loaded when more information on the host hardware is available this allows our vertex cache optimization to often outperform other methods in fact our algorithms can even be executed interactively allowing for re optimization in case of changes to geometry or topology which happen often in cad cam applications we believe that most real time rendering applications will immediately benefit from these new results

class sharing is new language mechanism for building extensible software systems recent work has separately explored two different kinds of extensibility first family inheritance in which an entire family of related classes can be inherited and second adaptation in which existing objects are extended in place with new behavior and state class sharing integrates these two kinds of extensibility mechanisms with little programmer effort objects of one family can be used as members of another while preserving relationships among objects therefore family of classes can be adapted in place with new functionality spanning multiple classes object graphs can evolve from one family to another adding or removing functionality even at run time several new mechanisms support this flexibility while ensuring type safety class sharing has been implemented as an extension to java and its utility for evolving and extending software is demonstrated with realistic systems

in parallel adaptive applications the computational structure of the applications changes over time leading to load imbalances even though the initial load distributions were balanced to restore balance and to keep communication volume low in further iterations of the applications dynamic load balancing repartitioning of the changed computational structure is required repartitioning differs from static load balancing partitioning due to the additional requirement of minimizing migration cost to move data from an existing partition to new partition in this paper we present novel repartitioning hypergraph model for dynamic load balancing that accounts for both communication volume in the application and migration cost to move data in order to minimize the overall cost the use of hypergraph based model allows us to accurately model communication costs rather than approximate them with graph based models we show that the new model can be realized using hypergraph partitioning with fixed vertices and describe our parallel multilevel implementation within the zoltan load balancing toolkit to the best of our knowledge this is the first implementation for dynamic load balancing based on hypergraph partitioning to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach we conducted experiments on linux cluster with processors the results show that in terms of reducing total cost our new model compares favorably to the graph based dynamic load balancing approaches and multilevel approaches improve the repartitioning quality significantly
secure broadcasting of web documents is becoming crucial requirement for many web based applications under the broadcast document dissemination strategy web document source periodically broadcasts portions of its documents to potentially large community of users without the need for explicit requests by secure broadcasting we mean that the delivery of information to users must obey the access control policies of the document source traditional access control mechanisms that have been adapted for xml documents however do not address the performance issues inherent in access control in this paper labeling scheme is proposed to support rapid reconstruction of xml documents in the context of well known method called xml pool encryption the proposed labeling scheme supports the speedy inference of structure information in all portions of the document the binary representation of the proposed labeling scheme is also investigated in the experimental results the proposed labeling scheme is efficient in searching for the location of decrypted information
this paper presents the alpha ev conditional branch predictor the alpha ev microprocessor project canceled in june in late phase of development envisioned an aggressive wide issue out of order superscalar microarchitecture featuring very deep pipeline and simultaneous multithreading performance of such processor is highly dependent on the accuracy of its branch predictor and consequently very large silicon area was devoted to branch prediction on ev the alpha ev branch predictor relies on global history and features total of kbitsthe focus of this paper is on the different trade offs performed to overcome various implementation constraints for the ev branch predictor one such instance is the pipelining of the predictor on two cycles to facilitate the prediction of up to branches per cycle from any two dynamically successive instruction fetch blocks this resulted in the use of three fetch block old compressed branch history information for accesing the predictor implementation constraints also restricted the composition of the index functions for the predictor and forced the usage of only single ported memory cellsnevertheless we show that the alpha ev branch predictor achieves prediction accuracy in the same range as the state of the art academic global history branch predictors that do not consider implementation constraints in great detail
the widespread use of internet based services is increasing the amount of information such as user profiles that clients are required to disclose this information demand is necessary for regulating access to services and functionally convenient eg to support service customization but it has raised privacy related concerns which if not addressed may affect the users disposition to use network services at the same time servers need to regulate service access without disclosing entirely the details of their access control policy there is therefore pressing need for privacy aware techniques to regulate access to services open to the networkwe propose an approach for regulating service access and information disclosure on the web the approach consists of uniform formal framework to formulate and reason about both service access and information disclosure constraints it also provides means for parties to communicate their requirements while ensuring that no private information be disclosed and that the communicated requirements are correct with respect to the constraints
mobile is an extension of the net common intermediate language that supports certified in lined reference monitoring mobile programs have the useful property that if they are well typed with respect to declared security policy then they are guaranteed not to violate that security policy when executed thus when an in lined reference monitor irm is expressed in mobile it can be certified by simple type checker to eliminate the need to trust the producer of the irmsecurity policies in mobile are declarative can involve unbounded collections of objects allocated at runtime and can regard infinite length histories of security events exhibited by those objects the prototype mobile implementation enforces properties expressed by finite state security automata one automaton for each security relevant object and can type check mobile programs in the presence of exceptions finalizers concurrency and non termination executing mobile programs requires no change to existing net virtual machine implementations since mobile programs consist of normal managed cil code with extra typing annotations stored in net attributes
the fields of machine learning and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined optimization problems lie at the heart of most machine learning approaches the special topic on machine learning and large scale optimization examines this interplay machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued the special topic includes models using quadratic linear second order cone semi definite and semi infinite programs we observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different mathematical programming puts premium on accuracy speed and robustness since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off line accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for specific classes of problems reducing machine learning problems to well explored mathematical programming classes with robust general purpose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques in turn machine learning presents new challenges to mathematical programming the special issue include papers from two primary themes novel machine learning models and novel optimization approaches for existing models many papers blend both themes making small changes in the underlying core mathematical program that enable the develop of effective new algorithms
we propose xrpc minimal xquery extension that enables distributed yet efficient querying of heterogeneous xquery data sources xrpc enhances the existing concept of xquery functions with the remote procedure call rpc paradigm by calling out of an xquery for loop to multiple destinations and by calling functions that themselves perform xrpc calls complex pp communication patterns can be achieved the xrpc extension is orthogonal to all xquery features including the xquery update facility xquf we provide formal semantics for xrpc that encompasses execution of both read only and update queries xrpc is also network soap sub protocol that integrates seamlessly with web services and service oriented architectures soa and ajax based guis crucial feature of the protocol is bulk rpc that allows remote execution of many different calls to the same procedure using possibly single network round trip the efficiency potential of xrpc is demonstrated via an open source implementation in monetdb xquery we show however that xrpc is not system specific every xquery data source can service xrpc calls using wrapper since xquery is pure functional language we can leverage techniques developed for functional query decomposition to rewrite data shipping queries into xrpc based function shipping queries powerful distributed database techniques such as semi join optimizations directly map on bulk rpc opening up interesting future work opportunities
haptic gestures and sensations through the sense of touch are currently unavailable in remote communication there are two main reasons for this good quality haptic technology has not been widely available and knowledge on the use of this technology is limited to address these challenges we studied how users would like to and managed to create spatial haptic information by gesturing two separate scenario based experiments were carried out an observation study without technological limitations and study on gesturing with functional prototype with haptic actuators the first study found three different use strategies for the device the most common gestures were shaking smoothing and tapping multimodality was requested to create the context for the communication and to aid the interpretation of haptic stimuli the second study showed that users were able to utilize spatiality in haptic messages eg forward backward gesture for agreement however challenges remain in presenting more complex information via remote haptic communication the results give guidance for communication activities that are usable in spatial haptic communication and how to make it possible to enable this form of communication in reality
as parallelism in microprocessors becomes mainstream new prog ramming languages and environments are emerging to meet the challenges of parallel programming to support research on these languages we are developing low level language infrastructure called pillar derived from parallel implementation language although pillar programs are intended to be automatically generated from source programs in each parallel language pillar programs can also be written by expert programmers the language is defined as small set of extensions to as result pillar is familiar to programmers but more importantly it is practical to reuse an existing optimizing compiler like gcc or open to implement pillar compilerpillar's concurrency features include constructs for threading synchronization and explicit data parallel operations the threading constructs focus on creating new threads only when hardware resources are idle and otherwise executing parallel work within existing threads thus minimizing thread creation overhead in addition to the usual synchronization constructs pillar includes transactional memory its sequential features include stack walking second class continuations support for precise garbage collection tail calls and seamless integration of pillar and legacy code this paper describes the design and implementation of the pillar software stack including the language compiler runtime and high level converters that translate high level language programs into pillar programs it also reports on early experience with three high level languages that target pillar
real time java is quickly emerging as platform for building safety critical embedded systems the real time variants of java including are attractive alternatives to ada and since they provide cleaner simpler and safer programming model unfortunately current real time java implementations have trouble scaling down to very hard real time embedded settings where memory is scarce and processing power is limited in this paper we describe the architecture of the fiji vm which enables vanilla java applications to run in very hard environments including booting on bare hardware with only very rudimentary operating system support we also show that our minimalistic approach delivers comparable performance to that of server class production java virtual machine implementations
research on ontologies is becoming widespread in the biomedical informatics community at the same time it has become apparent that the challenges of properly constructing and maintaining ontologies have proven more difficult than many workers in the field initially expected discovering general feasible methods has thus become central activity for many of those hoping to reap the benefits of ontologies this paper reviews current methods in the construction maintenance alignment and evaluation of ontologies
the classification performance of nearest prototype classifiers largely relies on the prototype learning algorithm the minimum classification error mce method and the soft nearest prototype classifier snpc method are two important algorithms using misclassification loss this paper proposes new prototype learning algorithm based on the conditional log likelihood loss cll which is based on the discriminative model called log likelihood of margin logm regularization term is added to avoid over fitting in training as well as to maximize the hypothesis margin the cll in the logm algorithm is convex function of margin and so shows better convergence than the mce in addition we show the effects of distance metric learning with both prototype dependent weighting and prototype independent weighting our empirical study on the benchmark datasets demonstrates that the logm algorithm yields higher classification accuracies than the mce generalized learning vector quantization glvq soft nearest prototype classifier snpc and the robust soft learning vector quantization rslvq and moreover the logm with prototype dependent weighting achieves comparable accuracies to the support vector machine svm classifier
the evolution of multimedia technology and the internet boost the multimedia sharing and searching activities among social networks the requirements of semantic multimedia retrieval goes far beyond those provided by the text based search engines technology here we present an collaborative approach that enables the semantic search of the multimedia objects by the collective discovery and meaningful indexing of their semantic concepts through the successive use of our model semantic concepts can be discovered and incorporated by analyzing the users search queries relevance feedback and selection patterns eventually through the growth and evolution of the index hierarchy the semantic index can be dynamically constructed validated and naturally built up towards the expectation of the social network
in this study we describe methodology to exploit specific type of domain knowledge in order to find tighter error bounds on the performance of classification via support vector machines the domain knowledge we consider is that the input space lies inside of specified convex polytope first we consider prior knowledge about the domain by incorporating upper and lower bounds of attributes we then consider more general framework that allows us to encode prior knowledge in the form of linear constraints formed by attributes by using the ellipsoid method from optimization literature we show that this can be exploited to upper bound the radius of the hyper sphere that contains the input space and enables us to tighten generalization error bounds we provide comparative numerical analysis and show the effectiveness of our approach
common geographic information systems gis require high degree of expertise from its users making them difficult to be operated by laymen this paper describes novel approaches to easily perform typical basic spatial tasks within gis eg pan zoom and selection operations by using multi touch gestures in combination with foot gestures we are interested in understanding how non expert users interact with such multi touch surfaces we provide categorization and framework of multi touch hand gestures for interacting with gis this framework is based on an initial evaluation we present results of more detailed in situ study mainly focusing on multi user multi touch interaction with geospatial data furthermore we extend our framework using combination of multi touch gestures with small set of foot gestures to solve geospatial tasks
we study the problem of continuous monitoring of top queries over multiple non synchronized streams assuming sliding window model this general problem has been well addressed research topic in recent years most approaches however assume synchronized streams where all attributes of an object are known simultaneously to the query processing engine in many streaming scenarios though different attributes of an item are reported in separate non synchronized streams which do not allow for exact score calculations we present how the traditional notion of object dominance changes in this case such that the dominance set still includes all and only those objects which have chance of being among the top results in their life time based on this we propose an exact algorithm which builds on generating multiple instances of the same object in way that enables efficient object pruning we show that even with object pruning the necessary storage for exact evaluation of top queries is linear in the size of the sliding window as data should reside in main memory to provide fast answers in an online fashion and cope with high stream rates storing all this data may not be possible with limited resources we present an approximate algorithm which leverages correlation statistics of pairs of streams to evict more objects while maintaining accuracy we evaluate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments
this paper studies inductive definitions involving binders in which aliasing between free and bound names is permitted such aliasing occurs in informal specifications of operational semantics but is excluded by the common representation of binding as meta level abstraction drawing upon ideas from functional logic programming we represent such definitions with aliasing as recursively defined functions in higher order typed functional programming language that extends core ml with types for name binding type of semi decidable propositions and existential quantification for types with decidable equality we show that the representation is sound and complete with respect to the language's operational semantics which combines the use of evaluation contexts with constraint programming we also give new and simple proof that the associated constraint problem is np complete
the automated categorization or classification of texts into predefined categories has witnessed booming interest in the last years due to the increased availability of documents in digital form and the ensuing need to organize them in the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques general inductive process automatically builds classifier by learning from set of preclassified documents the characteristics of the categories the advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach consisting in the manual definition of classifier by domain experts are very good effectiveness considerable savings in terms of expert labor power and straightforward portability to different domains this survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm we will discuss in detail issues pertaining to three different problems namely document representation classifier construction and classifier evaluation
this paper describes new approach to indexing time series indexing time series is more problematic than indexing text since in extreme we need to find all possible subsequences in the time series sequence we propose to use signature files to index the time series and we also propose new method to index the signature files to speed up the search of large time series we propose novel index structure the signature tree for time series indexing we implemented the signature tree and we discuss its performance
rapid technological change has had an impact on the nature of software this has led to new exigencies and to demands for software engineering paradigms that pay particular atttention to meeting them we advocate that such demands can be met at least in large parts through the adoption of software engineering processes that are founded on reflective stance to this end we turn our attention to the field of design rationale we analyze and characterize design rationale approaches and show that despite surface differences between different approaches they all tend to be variants of relatively small set of static and dynamic affinities we use the synthesis of static and dynamic affinities to develop generic model for reflective design the model is nonprescriptive and affects minimally the design process it is context independent and is intended to be used as facilitator in participative design supporting group communication and deliberation the potential utility of the model is demonstrated through two examples one from the world of business design and the other from programming language design
publish subscribe systems have demonstrated the ability to scale to large numbers of users and high data rates when providing content based data dissemination services on the internet however their services are limited by the data semantics and query expressiveness that they support on the other hand the recent work on selective dissemination of xml data has made significant progress in moving from xml filtering to the richer functionality of transformation for result customization but in general has ignored the challenges of deploying such xml based services on an internet scale in this paper we address these challenges in the context of incorporating the rich functionality of xml data dissemination in highly scalable system we present the architectural design of onyx system based on an overlay network we identify the salient technical challenges in supporting xml filtering and transformation in this environment and propose techniques for solving them
it is difficult to write programs that behave correctly in the presence of run time errors existing programming language features often provide poor support for executing clean up code and for restoring invariants in such exceptional situations we present dataflow analysis for finding certain class of error handling mistakes those that arise from failure to release resources or to clean up properly along all paths many real world programs violate such resource safety policies because of incorrect error handling our flow sensitive analysis keeps track of outstanding obligations along program paths and does precise modeling of control flow in the presence of exceptions using it we have found over error handling mistakes almost million lines of java code the analysis is unsound and produces false positives but few simple filtering rules suffice to remove them in practice the remaining mistakes were manually verified these mistakes cause sockets files and database handles to be leaked along some paths we present characterization of the most common causes of those errors and discuss the limitations of exception handling finalizers and destructors in addressing them based on those errors we propose programming language feature that keeps track of obligations at run time and ensures that they are discharged finally we present case studies to demonstrate that this feature is natural efficient and can improve reliability for example retrofitting kloc program with it resulted in code size decrease surprising speed increase from correctly deallocating resources in the presence of exceptions and more consistent behavior

improving the precision of information retrieval has been challenging issue on chinese web as exemplified by chinese recipes on the web it is not easy natural for people to use keywords eg recipe names to search recipes since the names can be literally so abstract that they do not bear much if any information on the underlying ingredients or cooking methods in this paper we investigate the underlying features of chinese recipes and based on workflow like cooking procedures we model recipes as graphs we further propose novel similarity measurement based on the frequent patterns and devise an effective filtering algorithm to prune unrelated data so as to support efficient on line searching benefiting from the characteristics of graphs frequent common patterns can be mined from cooking graph database so in our prototype system called recipeview we extend the subgraph mining algorithm fsg to cooking graphs and combine it with our proposed similarity measurement resulting in an approach that well caters for specific users needs our initial experimental studies show that the filtering algorithm can efficiently prune unrelated cooking graphs without affecting the retrieval performance and the similarity measurement gets relatively higher precision recall against its counterparts
we study epidemic schemes in the context of collaborative data delivery in this context multiple chunks of data reside at different nodes and the challenge is to simultaneously deliver all chunks to all nodes here we explore the inter operation between the gossip of multiple simultaneous message chunks in this setting interacting nodes must select which chunk among many to exchange in every communication round we provide an efficient solution that possesses the inherent robustness and scalability of gossip our approach maintains the simplicity of gossip and has low message connections and computation overhead because our approach differs from solutions proposed by network coding we are able to provide insight into the tradeoffs and analysis of the problem of collaborative content distribution we formally analyze the performance of the algorithm demonstrating its efficiency with high probability
in field study conducted at leading fortune company we examined how having development teams reside in their own large room an arrangement called radical collocation affected system development the collocated projects had significantly higher productivity and shorter schedules than both the industry benchmarks and the performance of past similar projects within the firm the teams reported high satisfaction about their process and both customers and project sponsors were similarly highly satisfied the analysis of questionnaire interview and observational data from these teams showed that being at hand both visible and available helped them coordinate their work better and learn from each other radical collocation seems to be one of the factors leading to high productivity in these teams
in this paper we examine the issue of mining association rules among items in large database of sales transactions mining association rules means that given database of sales transactions to discover all associations among items such that the presence of some items in transaction will imply the presence of other items in the same transaction the mining of association rules can be mapped into the problem of discovering large itemsets where large itemset is group of items that appear in sufficient number of transactions the problem of discovering large itemsets can be solved by constructing candidate set of itemsets first and then identifying within this candidate set those itemsets that meet the large itemset requirement generally this is done iteratively for each large itemset in increasing order of where large itemset is large itemset with items to determine large itemsets from huge number of candidate sets in early iterations is usually the dominating factor for the overall data mining performance to address this issue we develop an effective algorithm for the candidate set generation it is hash based algorithm and is especially effective for the generation of candidate set for large itemsets explicitly the number of candidate itemsets generated by the proposed algorithm is in orders of magnitude smaller than that by previous methods thus resolving the performance bottleneck note that the generation of smaller candidate sets enables us to effectively trim the transaction database size at much earlier stage of the iterations thereby reducing the computational cost for later iterations significantly the advantage of the proposed algorithm also provides us the opportunity of reducing the amount of disk required extensive simulation study is conducted to evaluate performance of the proposed algorithm
new principles framework is presented for retrieval evaluation of ranked outputs it applies decision theory to model relevance decision preferences and shows that the probability ranking principle prp specifies optimal ranking it has two new components namely probabilistic evaluation model and general measure of retrieval effectiveness its probabilities may be interpreted as subjective or objective ones its performance measure is the expected weighted rank which is the weighted average rank of retrieval list starting from this measure the expected forward rank and some existing retrieval effectiveness measures eg top precision and discounted cumulative gain are instantiated using suitable weighting schemes after making certain assumptions the significance of these instantiations is that the ranking prescribed by prp is shown to be optimal simultaneously for all these existing performance measures in addition the optimal expected weighted rank may be used to normalize the expected weighted rank of retrieval systems for summary performance comparison across different topics between systems the framework also extends prp and our evaluation model to handle graded relevance thereby generalizing the discussed existing measures eg top precision and probabilistic retrieval models for graded relevance
vision based technology such as motion detection has long been limited to the domain of powerful processor intensive systems such as desktop pc's and specialist hardware solutions with the advent of much faster mobile phone processors and memory we are now seeing plethora of feature rich software being deployed onto the mobile platform since these high powered smart phones are now equipped with cameras it has become feasible to combine their powerful processors and the camera to support new ways of interacting with the phone however it is not clear whether or not these processor intensive visual interactions can in fact be run at an acceptable speed on current mobile handsets in this paper we look at one of the most popular and widespread mobile smart phone systems the symbian and benchmark the speed accuracy and deployability of the three popular mobile languages we test pixel thresholding algorithm in python and java and rank them based on their speed within the context of intensive image based processing
this paper makes two contributions to architectural support for software debugging first it proposes novel statistics based on the fly bug detectionmethod called pc based invariant detection the idea is based on the observation that in most programs given memory location is typically accessed by only few instructions therefore by capturing the invariant of the set of pcs that normally access given variable we can detect accesses by outlier instructions which are often caused by memory corruption buffer overflow stack smashing or other memory related bugs since this method is statistics based it can detect bugs that do not violate any programming rules and that therefore are likely to be missed by many existing tools the second contribution is novel architectural extension called the check look aside buffer clb the clb uses bloom filter to reduce monitoring overheads in the recently proposed iwatcher architectural framework for software debugging the clb significantly reduces the overhead of pc based invariant debugging we demonstrate pc based invariant detection tool called accmon that leverages architectural run time system and compiler support our experimental results with seven buggy applications and total of ten bugs show that accmon can detect all ten bugs with few false alarms for five applications and for two applications and with low overhead times several existing tools evaluated including purify ccured and value based invariant detection tools fail to detect some of the bugs in addition purify's overhead is one order of magnitude higher than accmon's finally we show that the clb is very effective at reducing overhead
texture synthesis is important for many applications in computer graphics vision and image processing however it remains difficult to design an algorithm that is both efficient and capable of generating high quality results in this paper we present an efficient algorithm for realistic texture synthesis the algorithm is easy to use and requires only sample texture as input it generates textures with perceived quality equal to or better than those produced by previous techniques but runs two orders of magnitude faster this permits us to apply texture synthesis to problems where it has traditionally been considered impractical in particular we have applied it to constrained synthesis for image editing and temporal texture generation our algorithm is derived from markov random field texture models and generates textures through deterministic searching process we accelerate this synthesis process using tree structured vector quantization
icooolps was the first edition ofecoop icooolps workshop it intended to bring researchers and practitioners both from academia and industry together with spirit of openness to try and identify and begin to address the numerous and very varied issues of optimization this succeeded as can be seen from the papers the attendance and the liveliness of the discussions that took place during and after the workshop not to mention few new cooperations or postdoctoral contracts the talented people from different groups who participated were unanimous to appreciate this first edition and recommend that icooolps be continued next year community is thus beginning to form and should be reinforced by second edition next year with all the improvements this first edition made emerge
the distance or similarity metric plays an important role in many natural language processing nlp tasks previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of number of metrics such as the jaccard coefficient especially in synonym acquisition while the existing metrics perform quite well to further improve performance we propose the use of supervised machine learning algorithm that fine tunes them given the known instances of similar or dissimilar words we estimated the parameters of the mahalanobis distance we compared number of metrics in our experiments and the results show that the proposed metric has higher mean average precision than other metrics
schema mapping is high level declarative specification of the relationship between two schemas it specifies how data structured under one schema called the source schema is to be converted into data structured under possibly different schema called the target schema schema mappings are fundamental components for both data exchange and data integration to date language for specifying or programming schema mappings exists however developmental support for programming schema mappings is still lacking in particular tool for debugging schema mappings has not yet been developed in this paper we propose to build debugger for understanding and exploring schema mappings we present primary feature of our debugger called routes that describes the relationship between source and target data with the schema mapping we present two algorithms for computing all routes or one route for selected target data both algorithms execute in polynomial time in the size of the input in computing all routes our algorithm produces concise representation that factors common steps in the routes furthermore every minimal route for the selected data can essentially be found in this representation our second algorithm is able to produce one route fast if there is one and alternative routes as needed we demonstrate the feasibility of our route algorithms through set of experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets
we generalize the method of constructing windows in subsequence matching by this generalization we can explain earlier subsequence matching methods as special cases of common framework based on the generalization we propose new subsequence matching method general match the earlier work by faloutsos et al called frm for convenience causes lot of false alarms due to lack of point filtering effect dual match recently proposed as dual approach of frm improves performance significantly over frm by exploiting point filtering effect however it has the problem of having smaller allowable window size half that of frm given the minimum query length smaller window increases false alarms due to window size effect general match offers advantages of both methods it can reduce window size effect by using large windows like frm and at the same time can exploit point filtering effect like dual match general match divides data sequences into generalized sliding windows sliding windows and the query sequence into generalized disjoint windows disjoint windows we formally prove that general match is correct ie it incurs no false dismissal we then propose method of estimating the optimal value of the sliding factor that minimizes the number of page accesses experimental results for real stock data show that for low selectivities sim general match improves average performance by over dual match and by over frm for high selectivities sim by over dual match and by over frm the proposed generalization provides an excellent theoretical basis for understanding the underlying mechanisms of subsequence matching
database reverse engineering dbre methods recover conceptual data models from physical databases the bottom up nature of these methods imposes two major limitations first they do not provide an initial high level abstract schema suitable for use as basis for reasoning about the application domain single detailed schema is only produced at the very end of the project second they provide no support for divide and conquer approach the entire database schema must be analysed and processed as unit this paper presents simple solution to overcome both limitations in our proposal relations are grouped based on their primary keys each group can be perceived in two ways as relational schema that can be reversed engineered as standalone dbre project and as an element either an entity or relationship of high level abstract schema that provides initial insight about the application domain we also present examples from actual large database systems
gene expression data are numerical and describe the level of expression of genes in different situations thus featuring behaviour of the genes two methods based on fca formal concept analysis are considered for clustering gene expression data the first one is based on interordinal scaling and can be realized using standard fca algorithms the second method is based on pattern structures and needs adaptations of standard algorithms to computing with interval algebra the two methods are described in details and discussed the second method is shown to be more computationally efficient and providing more readable results experiments with gene expression data are discussed
due to an increasing volume of xml data it is considered prudent to store xml data on an industry strength database system instead of relying on domain specific application or file system for shredded xml data stored in the relational tables however it may not be straightforward to apply existing algorithms for twig query processing because most of the algorithms require xml data to be accessed in form of streams of elements grouped by their tags and sorted in particular order in order to support xml query processing within the common framework of relational database systems we first propose several bitmap indexes for supporting holistic twig joins on xml data stored in the relational tables since bitmap indexes are well supported in most of the commercial and open source database systems the proposed bitmap indexes and twig query processing algorithms can be incorporated into the relational query processing framework with more ease the proposed query processing algorithms are efficient in terms of both time and space since the compressed bitmap indexes stay compressed during query processing in addition we propose hybrid index which computes twig query solutions with only bit vectors without accessing labeled xml elements stored in the relational tables
incompleteness due to missing attribute values aka null values is very common in autonomous web databases on which user accesses are usually supported through mediators traditional query processing techniques that focus on the strict soundness of answer tuples often ignore tuples with critical missing attributes even if they wind up being relevant to user query ideally we would like the mediator to retrieve such possibleanswers and gauge their relevance by accessing their likelihood of being pertinent answers to the query the autonomous nature of web databases poses several challenges in realizing this objective such challenges include the restricted access privileges imposed on the data the limited support for query patterns and the bounded pool of database and network resources in the web environment we introduce novel query rewriting and optimization framework qpiad that tackles these challenges our technique involves reformulating the user query based on mined correlations among the database attributes the reformulated queries are aimed at retrieving the relevant possibleanswers in addition to the certain answers qpiad is able to gauge the relevance of such queries allowing tradeoffs in reducing the costs of database query processing and answer transmission to support this framework we develop methods for mining attribute correlations in terms of approximate functional dependencies value distributions in the form of naïve bayes classifiers and selectivity estimates we present empirical studies to demonstrate that our approach is able to effectively retrieve relevant possibleanswers with high precision high recall and manageable cost
it is envisaged that the application of the multilevel security mls scheme will enhance flexibility and effectiveness of authorization policies in shared enterprise databases and will replace cumbersome authorization enforcement practices through complicated view definitions on per user basis however the critical problem with the current model is that the belief higher security level is cluttered with irrelevant or inconsistent data as no mechanism for attenuation is supported critics also argue that it is imperative for mls database users to theorize about the belief of others perhaps at different security levels an apparatus that is currently missing and the absence of which in seriously feltthe impetus for our current research is the need to provide an adequate framework for belief reasoning in mls databases in this paper we show that these concepts can be captured in logic style declarative query language called multilog for mls deductive databases for which proof theoretic model theoretic and fixpoint semantics exist this development is significant from database perspective as it now enables us to compute the semantics of multilog databases in bottom up fashion we also define bottom up procedure to compute unique models of stratified multilog databases finally we establish the equivalence of multilog's three logical characterizations model theory fixpoint theory and proof theory
microprocessor trends are moving towards wider architectures and more aggressive speculation with the increasing transistor budgets energy consumption has become critical design constraint to address this problem several researchers have proposed and evaluated energy efficient variants of speculation mechanisms however such hardware is typically evaluated in isolation and its impact on the energy consumption of the rest of the processor for example due to wrong path executions is ignored moreover the available metrics that would provide thorough evaluation of an architectural optimization employ somewhat complicated formulas with hard to measure parametersin this paper we introduce simple method to accurately compare the energy efficiency of speculative architectures our metric is based on runtime analysis of the entire processor chip and thus captures the energy consumption due to the positive as well as the negative activities that arise from the speculation activities we demonstrate the usefulness of our metric on the example of value speculation where we found some proposed value predictors including low power designs not to be energy efficient
middle domain mobility management provides an efficient routing low registration cost and handoff latency for layer ip layer based mobile network environment in the middle domain the base station bs acts as an agent or proxy to manage mobile networks to achieve this goal the bs could only address external traffic but without internal case management in order to complement this defect an enhanced version for the middle domain mobility management is designed in this paper moreover we research and design the multicast extension for the middle domain by applying the idea of the enhancement which is called hmp hierarchical multicast protocol associated handoff scheme is also proposed in this paper since it is complicated case for designing the multicast service in network environment we need characteristic method to address this case in order to fulfill this achievement of designing hmp scheme we introduce reduction process rp in this paper by using the rp complicated based network environment can be actually reduced to simpler network environment the mathematical analysis and simulation study are presented for performance evaluation simulation results have demonstrated that the enhanced middle domain mobility management has the better network performance in terms of registration cost handoff latency and routing cost in comparing with conventional mobility management schemes moreover the proposed multicast extension for hmp scheme is simple and has scalability and network performance advantages over other approaches in mobile multicasting
there are many design challenges in the hardware software co design approach for performance improvement of data intensive streaming applications with general purpose microprocessor and hardware accelerator these design challenges are mainly to prevent hardware area fragmentation to increase resource utilization to reduce hardware reconfiguration cost and to partition and schedule the tasks between the microprocessor and the hardware accelerator efficiently for performance improvement and power savings of the applications in this paper modular and block based hardware configuration architecture named memory aware run time reconfigurable embedded system martres is proposed for efficient resource management and performance improvement of streaming applications subsequently we design task placement algorithm named hierarchical best fit ascending hbfa algorithm to prove that martres configuration architecture is very efficient in increased resource utilization and flexible in task mapping and power savings the time complexity of hbfa algorithm is reduced to compared to traditional best fit bf algorithm's time complexity of when the quality of the placement solution by hbfa is better than that of bf algorithm finally we design an efficient task partitioning and scheduling algorithm named balanced partitioned and placement aware partitioning and scheduling algorithm bpasa in bpasa we exploit the temporal parallelism in streaming applications to reduce reconfiguration cost of the hardware while keeping in mind the required throughput of the output data we balance the exploitation of spatial parallelism and temporal parallelism in streaming applications by considering the reconfiguration cost vs the data transfer cost the scheduler refers to the hbfa placement algorithm to check whether contiguous area on fpga is available before scheduling the task for hw or for sw
search on pcs has become less efficient than searching the web due to the increasing amount of stored data in this paper we present an innovative desktop search solution which relies on extracted metadata context information as well as additional background information for improving desktop search results we also present practical application of this approach the extensible beagle toolbox to prove the validity of our approach we conducted series of experiments by comparing our results against the ones of regular desktop search solution beagle we show an improved quality in search and overall performance
the precision of many type based analyses can be significantly increased given additional information about the programs execution for this reason it is not uncommon for such analyses to integrate supporting analyses computing for instance nil pointer or alias information such integration is problematic for number of reasons it obscures the original intention of the type system especially if multiple additional analyses are added it makes use of already available analyses difficult since they have to be rephrased as type systems and it is non modular changing the supporting analyses implies changing the entire type systemusing ideas from abstract interpretation we present method for parameterizing type systems over the results of abstract analyses in such way that one modular correctness proof can be obtained this is achieved by defining general format for information transferal and use of the information provided by the abstract analyses the key gain from this method is clear separation between the correctness of the analyses and the type system both in the implementation and correctness proof which leads to comparatively easy way of changing the parameterized analysis and making use of precise and hence complicated analysesin addition we exemplify the use of the framework by presenting parameterized type system that uses additional information to improve the precision of exception types in small imperative language with arrays
the recent trend in web application development is moving towards exposing the service functionality through application programming interface api many web based services start to offer apis to support application to application integration with their consumers on top of the web the trend has raised the demand for average web developers to know how to design apis for web based services in this paper we summarise list of inherent issues in the web that developers should pay attention to describe how web architecture may help to resolve these issues and suggest design considerations for web api design in addition we demonstrate an experimental design process through case study to design web api for social bookmarking service
co located collaborators can see the artifacts that others are working on which in turn enables casual interactions to help distributed collaborators maintain mutual awareness of people's electronic work artifacts we designed and implemented an awareness tool that leverages screen sharing methods people see portions of others screens in miniature can selectively raise larger views of screen to get more detail and can engage in remote pointing people balance awareness with privacy by using several privacy protection strategies built into the system preliminary evaluation with two groups using this system shows that people use it to maintain awareness of what others are doing project certain image of themselves monitor progress coordinate joint tasks determine others availability and engage in serendipitous conversation and collaboration while privacy was not large concern for these groups theoretical analysis suggests that privacy risks may differ for other user communities
combining fine grained opinion information to produce opinion summaries is important for sentiment analysis applications toward that end we tackle the problem of source coreference resolution linking together source mentions that refer to the same entity the partially supervised nature of the problem leads us to define and approach it as the novel problem of partially supervised clustering we propose and evaluate new algorithm for the task of source coreference resolution that outperforms competitive baselines
this paper introduces method for converting an image or volume sampled on regular grid into space efficient irregular point hierarchy the conversion process retains the original frequency characteristics of the dataset by matching the spatial distribution of sample points with the required frequency to achieve good blending the spherical points commonly used in volume rendering are generalized to ellipsoidal point primitives family of multiresolution oriented gabor wavelets provide the frequency space analysis of the dataset the outcome of this frequency analysis is the reduced set of points in which the sampling rate is decreased in originally oversampled areas during rendering the traversal of the hierarchy can be controlled by any suitable error metric or quality criteria the local level of refinement is also sensitive to the transfer function areas with density ranges mapped to high transfer function variability are rendered at higher point resolution than others our decomposition is flexible and can be used for iso surface rendering alpha compositing and ray rendering of volumes we demonstrate our hierarchy with an interactive splatting volume renderer in which the traversal of the point hierarchy for rendering is modulated by user specified frame rate
in this paper we describe design orientated field study in which we deploy novel digital display device to explore the potential integration of teenage and family photo displays at home as well as the value of situated photo display technologies for intergenerational expression this exploration is deemed timely given the contemporary take up of digital capture devices by teenagers and the unprecedented volume of photographic content that teens generate findings support integration and the display of photos on standalone device as well as demonstrating the interventional efficacy of the design as resource for provoking reflection on the research subject we also draw upon the theoretical concept of dialogism to understand how our design mediates intergenerational relationships and interaction aesthetics relating to the notion of constructive conflict
key dependent message kdm security was introduced by black rogaway and shrimpton to address the case where key cycles occur among encryptions eg key is encrypted with itself it was mainly motivated by key cycles in dolev yao models ie symbolic abstractions of cryptography by term algebras and corresponding computational soundness result was later shown by ad atilde et al however both the kdm definition and this soundness result do not allow the general active attacks typical for dolev yao models or for security protocols in general we extend these definitions to obtain soundness result under active attacks we first present definition akdm adaptive kdm as kdm equivalent of authenticated symmetric encryption ie it provides chosen ciphertext security and integrity of ciphertexts for key cycles however this is not yet sufficient for the desired computational soundness result and thus we define dkdm dynamic kdm that additionally allows limited dynamic revelation of keys we show that dkdm is sufficient for computational soundness even in the strong sense of blackbox reactive simulatability brsim uc and in cases with joint terms with other operators we also build on current kdm secure schemes to construct schemes secure under the new definitions moreover we prove implications or construct separating examples respectively for new definitions and existing ones for symmetric encryption
spatial joins find all pairs of objects that satisfy given spatial relationship in spatial joins using indexes original space indexes such as the tree are widely used an original space index is the one that indexes objects as represented in the original space since original space indexes deal with extents of objects it is relatively complex to optimize join algorithms using these indexes on the other hand transform space indexes which transform objects in the original space into points in the transform space and index them deal only with points but no extents thus optimization of join algorithms using these indexes can be relatively simple however the disadvantage of these join algorithms is that they cannot be applied to original space indexes such as the tree in this paper we present novel mechanism for achieving the best of these two types of algorithms specifically we propose the new notion of the transform space view and present the transform space view join algorithm the transform space view is virtual transform space index based on an original space index it allows us to interpret or view an existing original space index as transform space index with no space and negligible time overhead and without actually modifying the structure of the original space index or changing object representation the transform space view join algorithm joins two original space indexes in the transform space through the notion of the transform space view through analysis and experiments we verify the excellence of the transform space view join algorithm the transform space view join algorithm always outperforms existing ones for all the data sets tested in terms of all three measures used the one pass buffer size the minimum buffer size required for guaranteeing one disk access per page the number of disk accesses for given buffer size and the wall clock time thus it constitutes lower bound algorithm we believe that the proposed transform space view can be applied to developing various new spatial query processing algorithms in the transform space
form comparison is fundamental part of many anthropometric biological anthropological archaeological and botanical researches etc in traditional anthropometric form comparison methods geometry characteristics and internal structure of surface points are not adequately considered form comparison of anthropometric data can make up the deficiency of traditional methods in this paper methods for analyzing other than objects are highlighted we summarize the advance of form comparison techniques in the last decades according to whether they are based upon anatomical landmarks we partition them into two main categories landmark based methods and landmark free methods the former methods are further sub divided into deformation methods superimposition methods and methods based on linear distances while the latter methods are sub divided into shape statistics based methods methods based on function analysis view based methods topology based methods and hybrid methods examples for each method are presented the discussion about their advantages and disadvantages are also introduced

as the issue width of superscalar processors is increased instruction fetch bandwidth requirements will also increase it will become necessary to fetch multiple basic blocks per cycle conventional instruction caches hinder this effort because long instruction sequences are not always in contiguous cache locations we propose supplementing the conventional instruction cache with trace cache this structure caches traces of the dynamic instruction stream so instructions that are otherwise noncontiguous appear contiguous for the instruction benchmark suite ibs and spec integer benchmarks kilobyte trace cache improves performance on average by over conventional sequential fetching further it is shown that the trace cache's efficient low latency approach enables it to outperform more complex mechanisms that work solely out of the instruction cache
interactive tabletop and wall surfaces support collaboration and interactivity in novel ways apart from keyboards and mice such systems can also incorporate other input devices namely laser pointers marker pens with screen location sensors or touch sensitive surfaces similarly instead of vertically positioned desktop monitor collaborative setups typically use much larger displays which are oriented either vertically wall or horizontally tabletop or combine both kinds of surfaces in this paper we describe an empirical study that investigates how technical system constraints can affect group performance in high pace collaborative tasks for this we compare various input and output modalities in system that consists of several interactive tabletop and wall surface we observed that the performance of group of people scaled almost linearly with the number of participants on an almost perfectly parallel task we also found that mice were significantly faster than laser pointers but only by also interaction on walls was significantly faster than on the tabletop by
the widespread deployment of recommender systems has lead to user feedback of varying quality while some users faithfully express their true opinion many provide noisy ratings which can be detrimental to the quality of the generated recommendations the presence of noise can violate modeling assumptions and may thus lead to instabilities in estimation and prediction even worse malicious users can deliberately insert attack profiles in an attempt to bias the recommender system to their benefit while previous research has attempted to study the robustness of various existing collaborative filtering cf approaches this remains an unsolved problem approaches such as neighbor selection algorithms association rules and robust matrix factorization have produced unsatisfactory results this work describes new collaborative algorithm based on svd which is accurate as well as highly stable to shilling this algorithm exploits previously established svd based shilling detection algorithms and combines it with svd based cf experimental results show much diminished effect of all kinds of shilling attacks this work also offers significant improvement over previous robust collaborative filtering frameworks
distributed multimedia applications require support from the underlying operating system to achieve and maintain their desired quality of service qos this has led to the creation of novel task and message schedulers and to the development of qos mechanisms that allow applications to explicitly interact with relevant operating system services however the task scheduling techniques developed to date are not well equipped to take advantage of such interactions as result important events such as position update messages in virtual environments may be ignored if cpu scheduler ignores these events players will experience lack of responsiveness or even inconsistencies in the virtual world this paper argues that real time and multimedia applications can benefit from coordinatedel event delivery mechanism termed ecalls that supports such coordination we then show ecalls's ability to reduce variations in inter frame times for media streams

this paper presents probabilistic mixture modeling framework for the hierarchic organisation of document collections it is demonstrated that the probabilistic corpus model which emerges from the automatic or unsupervised hierarchical organisation of document collection can be further exploited to create kernel which boosts the performance of state of the art support vector machine document classifiers it is shown that the performance of such classifier is further enhanced when employing the kernel derived from an appropriate hierarchic mixture model used for partitioning document corpus rather than the kernel associated with flat non hierarchic mixture model this has important implications for document classification when hierarchic ordering of topics exists this can be considered as the effective combination of documents with no topic or class labels unlabeled data labeled documents and prior domain knowledge in the form of the known hierarchic structure in providing enhanced document classification performance
we describe the design implementation and performance of new parallel sparse cholesky factorization code the code uses multifrontal factorization strategy operations on small dense submatrices are performed using new dense matrix subroutines that are part of the code although the code can also use the blas and lapack the new code is recursive at both the sparse and the dense levels it uses novel recursive data layout for dense submatrices and it is parallelized using cilk an extension of specifically designed to parallelize recursive codes we demonstrate that the new code performs well and scales well on smps in particular on up to processors the code outperforms two state of the art message passing codes the scalability and high performance that the code achieves imply that recursive schedules blocked data layouts and dynamic scheduling are effective in the implementation of sparse factorization codes
several researchers have analysed the performance of ary cubes taking into account channel bandwidth constraints imposed by implementation technology namely the constant wiring density and pin out constraints for vlsi and multiple chip technology respectively for instance dally ieee trans comput abraham issues in the architecture of direct interconnection networks schemes for multiprocessors phd thesis university of illinois at urbana champaign and agrawal ieee trans parallel distributed syst have shown that low dimensional ary cubes known as tori outperform their high dimensional counterparts known as hypercubes under the constant wiring density constraint however abraham and agrawal have arrived at an opposite conclusion when they considered the constant pin out constraint most of these analyses have assumed deterministic routing where message always uses the same network path between given pair of nodes more recent multicomputers have incorporated adaptive routing to improve performance this paper re examines the relative performance merits of the torus and hypercube in the context of adaptive routing our analysis reveals that the torus manages to exploit its wider channels under light traffic as traffic increases however the hypercube can provide better performance than the torus our conclusion under the constant wiring density constraint is different from that of the works mentioned above because adaptive routing enables the hypercube to exploit its richer connectivity to reduce message blocking
with the increasing use of multi core microprocessors and hardware accelerators in embedded media processing systems there is an increasing need to discover coarse grained parallelism in media applications written in and common versions of these codes use pointer heavy sequential programming model to implement algorithms with high levels of inherent parallelism the lack of automated tools capable of discovering this parallelism has hampered the productivity of parallel programmers and application specific hardware designers as well as inhibited the development of automatic parallelizing compilers automatic discovery is challenging due to shifts in the prevalent programming languages scalability problems of analysis techniques and the lack of experimental research in combining the numerous analyses necessary to achieve clear view of the relations among memory accesses in complex programs this paper is based on coherent prototype system designed to automatically find multiple levels of coarse grained parallelism it visits several of the key analyses that are necessary to discover parallelism in contemporary media applications distinguishing those that perform satisfactorily at this time from those that do not yet have practical scalable solutions we show that contrary to common belief compiler with strong synergistic portfolio of modern analysis capabilities can automatically discover very substantial amount of coarse grained parallelism in complex media applications such as an mpeg encoder these results suggest that an automatic coarse grained parallelism discovery tool can be built to greatly enhance the software and hardware development processes of future embedded media processing systems
wireless sensor networks offer the potential to span and monitor large geographical areas inexpensively sensors however have significant power constraint battery life making communication very expensive another important issue in the context of sensor based information systems is that individual sensor readings are inherently unreliable in order to address these two aspects sensor database systems like tinydb and cougar enable in network data aggregation to reduce the communication cost and improve reliability the existing data aggregation techniques however are limited to relatively simple types of queries such as sum count avg and min max in this paper we propose data aggregation scheme that significantly extends the class of queries that can be answered using sensor networks these queries include approximate quantiles such as the median the most frequent data values such as the consensus value histogram of the data distribution as well as range queries in our scheme each sensor aggregates the data it has received from other sensors into fixed user specified size message we provide strict theoretical guarantees on the approximation quality of the queries in terms of the message size we evaluate the performance of our aggregation scheme by simulation and demonstrate its accuracy scalability and low resource utilization for highly variable input data sets
finding correlated sequential patterns in large sequence databases is one of the essential tasks in data mining since huge number of sequential patterns are usually mined but it is hard to find sequential patterns with the correlation according to the requirement of real applications the needed data analysis should be different in previous mining approaches after mining the sequential patterns sequential patterns with the weak affinity are found even with high minimum support in this paper new framework is suggested for mining weighted support affinity patterns in which an objective measure sequential ws confidence is developed to detect correlated sequential patterns with weighted support affinity patterns to efficiently prune the weak affinity patterns it is proved that ws confidence measure satisfies the anti monotone and cross weighted support properties which can be applied to eliminate sequential patterns with dissimilar weighted support levels based on the framework weighted support affinity pattern mining algorithm wsminer is suggested the performance study shows that wsminer is efficient and scalable for mining weighted support affinity patterns

recent studies of internet traffic have shown that flow size distributions often exhibit high variability property in the sense that most of the flows are short and more than half of the total load is constituted by small percentage of the largest flows in the light of this observation it is interesting to revisit scheduling policies that are known to favor small jobs in order to quantify the benefit for small and the penalty for large jobs among all scheduling policies that do not require knowledge of job size the least attained service las scheduling policy is known to favor small jobs the most we investigate the las queue for both load and our analysis shows that for job size distributions with high variability property las favors short jobs with negligible penalty to the few largest jobs and that las achieves mean response time over all jobs that is close to the mean response time achieved by srptfinally we implement las in the ns network simulator to study its performance benefits for tcp flows when las is used to schedule packets over the bottleneck link more than of the shortest flows experience smaller mean response times under las than under fifo and only the largest jobs observe negligible increase in response time the benefit of using las as compared to fifo is most pronounced at high load
virtual immersive environments or telepresence setups often consist of multiple cameras that have to be calibrated we present convenient method for doing this the minimum is three cameras but there is no upper limit the method is fully automatic and freely moving bpdght spot is the only calibration object set of virtual points is made by waving the bright spot through the working volume its projections are found with subpixel precision and verified by robust ransac analysis the cameras do not have to see all points only reasonable overlap between camera subgroups is necessary projective structures are computed via rank factorization and the euclidean stratification is done by imposing geometric constraints this linear estimate initializes postprocessing computation of nonlinear distortion which is also fully automatic we suggest trick on how to use very ordinary laser pointer as the calibration object we show that it is possible to calibrate an immersive virtual environment with cameras in less than minutes reaching about pixel reprojection error the method has been successfully tested on numerous multicamera environments using varying numbers of cameras of varying quality
this letter analyzes the fisher kernel from statistical point of view the fisher kernel is particularly interesting method for constructing model of the posterior probability that makes intelligent use of unlabeled data ie of the underlying data density it is important to analyze and ultimately understand the statistical properties of the fisher kernel to this end we first establish sufficient conditions that the constructed posterior model is realizable ie it contains the true distribution realizability immediately leads to consistency results subsequently we focus on an asymptotic analysis of the generalization error which elucidates the learning curves of the fisher kernel and how unlabeled data contribute to learning we also point out that the squared or log loss is theoretically preferable because both yield consistent estimators to other losses such as the exponential loss when linear classifier is used together with the fisher kernel therefore this letter underlines that the fisher kernel should be viewed not as heuristics but as powerful statistical tool with well controlled statistical properties

quality of service qos support in local and cluster area environments has become an issue of great interest in recent years most current high performance interconnection solutions for these environments have been designed to enhance conventional best effort traffic performance but are not well suited to the special requirements of the new multimedia applications the multimedia router mmr aims at offering hardware based qos support within compact interconnection component one of the key elements in the mmr architecture are the algorithms used in traffic scheduling these algorithms are responsible for the order in which information is forwarded through the internal switch thus they are closely related to the qos provisioning mechanisms in this paper several traffic scheduling algorithms developed for the mmr architecture are described their general organization is motivated by chances for parallelization and pipelining while providing the necessary support both to multimedia flows and to best effort traffic performance evaluation results show that the qos requirements of different connections are met in spite of the presence of best effort traffic while achieving high link utilizations
aggregating statistical representations of classes is an important task for current trends in scaling up learning and recognition or for addressing them in distributed infrastructures in this perspective we address the problem of merging probabilistic gaussian mixture models in an efficient way through the search for suitable combination of components from mixtures to be merged we propose new bayesian modelling of this combination problem in association to variational estimation technique that handles efficiently the model complexity issue main feature of the present scheme is that it merely resorts to the parameters of the original mixture ensuring low computational cost and possibly communication should we operate on distributed system experimental results are reported on real data
conceptually the common approach to manipulating probabilistic data is to evaluate relational queries and then calculate the probability of each tuple in the result this approach ignores the possibility that the probabilities of complete answers are too low and hence partial answers with sufficiently high probabilities become important therefore we consider the semantics in which answers are maximal ie have the smallest degree of incompleteness subject tothe constraint that the probability is still above given threshold we investigate the complexity of joining relations under the above semantics in contrast to the deterministic case this approach gives rise to two different enumeration problems the first is finding all maximal sets of tuples that are join consistent connected and have joint probability above the threshold the second is computing all maximal tuples that are answers of partial joins and have probability above the threshold both problems are tractable under data complexity we also consider query and data complexity which rules out as efficient the following naive algorithm compute all partial answers and then choose the maximal ones among those with probabilities above the threshold we give efficient algorithms for several important special cases we also show that in general the first problem is np hard whereas the secondis hard
as microprocessor designs become increasingly powerand complexity conscious future microarchitectures must decrease their reliance on expensive dynamic scheduling structures while compilers have generally proven adept at planning useful static instruction level parallelism relying solely on the compiler instruction execution arrangement performs poorly when cache misses occur because variable latency is not well tolerated this paper proposes new microarchitectural model multipass pipelining that exploits meticulous compile time scheduling on simple in order hardware while achieving excellent cache miss tolerance through persistent advance preexecution beyond otherwise stalled instructions the pipeline systematically makes multiple passes through instructions that follow stalled instruction each pass increases the speed and energy efficiency of the subsequent ones by preserving computed results the concept of multiple passes and successive improvement of efficiency across passes in single pipeline distinguishes multipass pipelining from other runahead schemes simulation results show that the multipass technique achieves of the cycle reduction of aggressive out of order execution relative to in order execution in addition microarchitectural level power simulation indicates that benefits of multipass are achieved at fraction of the power overhead of full dynamic scheduling
an order dependent query is one whose result interpreted as multiset changes if the order of the input records is changed in stock quotes database for instance retrieving all quotes concerning given stock for given day does not depend on order because the collection of quotes does not depend on order by contrast finding stock's five price moving average in trades table gives result that depends on the order of the table query languages based on the relational data model can handle order dependent queries only through add ons sql for instance has new window mechanism which can sort data in limited parts of query add ons make order dependent queries dicult to write and to optimize in this paper we show that order can be natural property of the underlying data model and algebra we introduce new query language and algebra called aquery that supports order from the ground up new order related query transformations arise in this setting we show by experiment that this framework language plus optimization techniques brings orders of magnitude improvement over sql systems on many natural order dependent queries

attackers exploit software vulnerabilities to control or crash programs bouncer uses existing software instrumentation techniques to detect attacks and it generates filters automatically to block exploits of the target vulnerabilities the filters are deployed automatically by instrumenting system calls to drop exploit messages these filters introduce low overhead and they allow programs to keep running correctly under attack previous work computes filters using symbolic execution along the path taken by sample exploit but attackers can bypass these filters by generating exploits that follow different execution path bouncer introduces three techniques to generalize filters so that they are harder to bypass new form of program slicing that uses combination of static and dynamic analysis to remove unnecessary conditions from the filter symbolic summaries for common library functions that characterize their behavior succinctly as set of conditions on the input and generation of alternative exploits guided by symbolic execution bouncer filters have low overhead they do not have false positives by design and our results show that bouncer can generate filters that block all exploits of some real world vulnerabilities

routing overlays have become viable approach to working around slow bgp convergence and sub optimal path selection as well as to deploy novel forwarding architectures common sub component of routing overlay is routing mesh the route selection algorithm considers only those virtual links inter node links in an overlay in the routing mesh rather than all virtual links connecting an node overlay doing so reduces routing overhead thereby improving the scalability of the overlay as long as the process of constructing the mesh doesn't itself introduce overheadthis paper proposes and evaluates low cost approach to building topology aware routing mesh that eliminates virtual links that contain duplicate physical segments in the underlying network an evaluation of our method on planetlab shows that conservative link pruning algorithm reduces routing overhead by factor of two without negatively impacting route selection additional analysis quanti es the impact on route selection of defining an even sparser mesh on top of the topology aware routing mesh documenting the cost benefit tradeoff that is intrinsic to routing it also shows that constructing sparser routing mesh on the topology aware routing mesh rather than directly on the internet itself benefit from having the reduced number of duplicate physical segments in the underlying network which improves the resilience of the resulting routing mesh
independent parties that produce perfectly complementary components may form alliances or coalitions or groups to better coordinate their pricing decisions when they sell their products to downstream buyers this paper studies how market demand conditions ie the form of the demand function demand uncertainty and price sensitive demand drive coalition formation among complementary suppliers in deterministic demand model we show that for an exponential or isoelastic demand function suppliers always prefer selling in groups for linear power demand function suppliers may all choose to sell independently in equilibrium these results are interpreted through the pass through rate associated with the demand function in an uncertain demand model we show that in general the introduction of multiplicative stochastic element in demand has an insignificant impact on stable coalitions and that an endogenous retail price ie demand is price sensitive increases suppliers incentives to form alliances relative to the case with fixed retail price we also consider the impact of various other factors on stable outcomes in equilibrium eg sequential decision making by coalitions of different sizes the cost effect due to alliance formation either cost savings or additional costs and system without an assembler
user contributed wireless mesh networks are disruptive technology that may fundamentally change the economics of edge network access and bring the benefits of computer network infrastructure to local communities at low cost anywhere in the world to achieve high throughput despite highly unpredictable and lossy wireless channels it is essential that such networks take advantage of transmission opportunities wherever they emerge however as opportunistic routing departs from the traditional but less effective deterministic shortest path based routing user nodes in such networks may have less incentive to follow protocols and contribute in this paper we present the first routing protocols in which it is incentive compatible for each user node to honestly participate in the routing despite opportunistic transmissions we not only rigorously prove the properties of our protocols but also thoroughly evaluate complete implementation of our protocols experiments show that there is gain in throughput when compared with an opportunistic routing protocol that does not provide incentives and users can act selfishly

number of vertical mining algorithms have been proposed recently for association mining which have shown to be very effective and usually outperform horizontal approaches the main advantage of the vertical format is support for fast frequency counting via intersection operations on transaction ids tids and automatic pruning of irrelevant data the main problem with these approaches is when intermediate results of vertical tid lists become too large for memory thus affecting the algorithm scalabilityin this paper we present novel vertical data representation called diffset that only keeps track of differences in the tids of candidate pattern from its generating frequent patterns we show that diffsets drastically cut down the size of memory required to store intermediate results we show how diffsets when incorporated into previous vertical mining methods increase the performance significantly
we introduce comprehensive biomechanical model of the human upper body our model confronts the combined challenge of modeling and controlling more or less all of the relevant articular bones and muscles as well as simulating the physics based deformations of the soft tissues its dynamic skeleton comprises bones with jointed degrees of freedom including those of each vertebra and most of the ribs to be properly actuated and controlled the skeletal submodel requires comparable attention to detail with respect to muscle modeling we incorporate muscles each of which is modeled as piecewise uniaxial hill type force actuator to simulate biomechanically realistic flesh deformations we also develop coupled finite element model with the appropriate constitutive behavior in which are embedded the detailed anatomical geometries of the hard and soft tissues finally we develop an associated physics based animation controller that computes the muscle activation signals necessary to drive the elaborate musculoskeletal system in accordance with sequence of target poses specified by an animator
real time production systems and other dynamic environments often generate tremendous potentially infinite amount of stream data the volume of data is too huge to be stored on disks or scanned multiple times can we perform on line multi dimensional analysis and data mining of such data to alert people about dramatic changes of situations and to initiate timely high quality responses this is challenging task in this paper we investigate methods for on line multi dimensional regression analysis of time series stream data with the following contributions our analysis shows that only small number of compressed regression measures instead of the complete stream of data need to be registered for multi dimensional linear regression analysis to facilitate on line stream data analysis partially materialized data cube model with regression as measure and tilt time frame as its time dimension is proposed to minimize the amount of data to be retained in memory or stored on disks and an exception guided drilling approach is developed for on line multi dimensional exception based regression analysis based on this design algorithms are proposed for efficient analysis of time series data streams our performance study compares the proposed algorithms and identifies the most memory and time efficient one for multi dimensional stream data analysis
dynamic load balancing is key problem for the efficient use of parallel systems when solving applications with unpredictable load estimates however depending on the underlying programming paradigm single program multiple data spmd or multiple program multiple data mpmd the balancing requirements vary in spmd scenarios perfect load balance is desired whereas in mpmd scenarios it might be better to quickly obtain large reduction in load imbalance in short period of time we propose extending the local domain of given processor in the load balancing algorithms to find better scope for each paradigm for that purpose we present generalised version of the diffusion algorithm searching unbalanced domains called ds dasud which extends the local domain of each processor beyond its immediate neighbour ds dasud belongs to the iterative distributed load balancing idlb class and in its original formulation operates in diffusion scheme where processor balances its load with all its immediate neighbours ds we evaluate this algorithm for the two programming paradigms varying the domain size the evaluation was carried out using two simulators load balancing and network simulators for large set of load distributions that exhibit different degrees of initial workload unbalancing these distributions were applied to torus and hypercube topologies and the number of processors ranged from to from these experiments we conclude that the dasud fits well for spmd scenarios whereas for mpmd dasud and dasud for hypercube and torus topologies respectively obtain the best trade off between the imbalance reduction up to and the cost incurred in reaching it
we propose general methodology for analysing the behaviour of open systems modelled as coordinators ie open terms of suitable process calculi coordinator is understood as process with holes or placeholders where other coordinators and components ie closed terms can be plugged in thus influencing its behaviour the operational semantics of coordinators is given by means of symbolic transition system where states are coordinators and transitions are labeled by spatial modal formulae expressing the potential interaction that plugged components may enable behavioural equivalences for coordinators like strong and weak bisimilarities can be straightforwardly defined over such transition system different from other approaches based on universal closures ie where two coordinators are considered equivalent when all their closed instances are equivalent our semantics preserves the openness of the system during its evolution thus allowing dynamic instantiation to be accounted for in the semantics to further support the adequacy of the construction we show that our symbolic equivalences provide correct approximations of their universally closed counterparts coinciding with them over closed components for process calculi in suitable formats we show how tractable symbolic semantics can be defined constructively using unification
in decision support systems having knowledge on the top values is more informative and crucial than the maximum value unfortunately the naive method involves high computational cost and the existing methods for range max query are inefficient if applied directly in this paper we propose pre computed partition top method ppt to partition the data cube and pre store number of top values for improving query performance the main focus of this study is to find the optimum values for two parameters ie the partition factor and the number of pre stored values through analytical approach cost function based on poisson distribution is used for the analysis the analytical results obtained are verified against simulation results it is shown that the ppt method outperforms other alternative methods significantly when proper and are used
in this paper we concentrate on aspects related to modeling and formal verification of embedded systems first we define formal model of computation for embedded systems based on petri nets that can capture important features of such systems and allows their representation at different levels of granularity our modeling formalism has well defined semantics so that it supports precise representation of the system the use of formal methods to verify its correctness and the automation of different tasks along the design process second we propose an approach to the problem of formal verification of embedded systems represented in our modeling formalism we make use of model checking to prove whether certain properties expressed as temporal logic formulas hold with respect to the system model we introduce systematic procedure to translate our model into timed automata so that it is possible to use available model checking tools we propose two strategies for improving the verification efficiency the first by applying correctness preserving transformations and the second by exploring the degree of parallelism characteristic to the system some examples including realistic industrial case demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on practical applications
under frequent node arrival and departure churn in an overlay network structure the problem of preserving accessibility is addressed by maintaining valid entries in the routing tables towards nodes that are alive however if the system fails to replace the entries of dead nodes with entries of live nodes in the routing tables soon enough requests may fail in such cases mechanisms to route around failures are required to increase the tolerance to node failures existing distributed hash tables dhts overlays include extensions to provide fault tolerance when looking up keys however these are often insufficient we analyze the case of greedy routing often preferred for its simplicity but with limited dependability even when extensions are applied the main idea is that fault tolerance aspects need to be dealt with already at design time of the overlay we thus propose simple overlay that offers support for alternative paths and we create routing strategy which takes advantage of all these paths to route the requests while keeping maintenance cost low experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach provides an excellent resilience to failures

in the origin detection problem an algorithm is given set of documents ordered by creation time and query document it needs to output for every consecutive sequence of alphanumeric terms in the earliest document in in which the sequence appeared if such document exists algorithms for the origin detection problem can for example be used to detect the origin of text segments in and thus to detect novel content in they can also find the document from which the author of has copied the most or show that is mostly original we concentrate on solutions that use only fixed amount of memory we propose novel algorithms for this problem and evaluate them together with large number of previously published algorithms our results show that detecting the origin of text segments efficiently can be done with very high accuracy even when the space used is less than of the size of the documents in the precision degrades smoothly with the amount of available space various estimation techniques can be used to increase the performance of the algorithms
although deforming surfaces are frequently used in numerous domains only few works have been proposed until now for simplifying such data in this paper we propose new method for generating progressive deforming meshes based on shape feature analysis and deformation area preservation by computing the curvature and torsion of each vertex in the original model we add the shape feature factor to its quadric error metric when calculating each qem edge collapse cost in order to preserve the areas with large deformation we add deformation degree weight to the aggregated quadric errors when computing the unified edge contraction sequence finally the edge contraction order is slightly adjusted to further reduce the geometric distortion for each frame our approach is fast easy to implement and as result good quality dynamic approximations with well preserved fine details can be generated at any given frame

software system interacts with third party libraries through various apis using these library apis often needs tofollow certain usage patterns furthermore ordering rules specifications exist between apis and these rules govern the secure and robust operation of the system using these apis but these patterns and rules may not be well documented by the api developers previous approaches mine frequent association rules itemsets or subsequences that capture api call patterns shared by api client code however these frequent api patterns cannot completely capture some useful orderings shared by apis especially when multiple apis are involved across different procedures in this paper we present framework to automatically extract usage scenarios among user specified apis as partial orders directly from the source code api client code we adapt model checker to generate interprocedural control flow sensitive static traces related to the apis of interest different api usage scenarios are extracted from the static traces by our scenario extraction algorithm and fed to miner the miner summarizes different usage scenarios as compact partial orders specifications are extracted from the frequent partial orders using our specification extraction algorithm our experience of applying the framework on clients with loc in total has shown that theextracted api partial orders are useful in assisting effective api reuse and checking
reverse nearest neighbor rnn search is very crucial in many real applications in particular given database and query object an rnn query retrieves all the data objects in the database that have the query object as their nearest neighbors often due to limitation of measurement devices environmental disturbance or characteristics of applications for example monitoring moving objects data obtained from the real world are uncertain imprecise therefore previous approaches proposed for answering an rnn query over exact precise database cannot be directly applied to the uncertain scenario in this paper we re define the rnn query in the context of uncertain databases namely probabilistic reverse nearest neighbor prnn query which obtains data objects with probabilities of being rnns greater than or equal to user specified threshold since the retrieval of prnn query requires accessing all the objects in the database which is quite costly we also propose an effective pruning method called geometric pruning gp that significantly reduces the prnn search space yet without introducing any false dismissals furthermore we present an efficient prnn query procedure that seamlessly integrates our pruning method extensive experiments have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed gp based prnn query processing approach under various experimental settings
in this paper we consider how discrete time quantum walks can be applied to graph matching problems the matching problem is abstracted using an auxiliary graph that connects pairs of vertices from the graphs to be matched by way of auxiliary vertices discrete time quantum walk is simulated on this auxiliary graph and the quantum interference on the auxiliary vertices indicates possible matches when dealing with graphs for which there is no exact match the interference amplitudes together with edge consistencies are used to define consistency measure we also explore the use of the method for inexact graph matching problems we have tested the algorithm on graphs derived from the nci molecule database and found it to significantly reduce the space of possible permutation matchings typically by factor of thereby allowing the graphs to be matched directly an analysis of the quantum walk in the presence of structural errors between graphs is used as the basis of the consistency measure we test the performance of this measure on graphs derived from images in the coil database

content based image similarity search plays key role in multimedia retrieval each image is usually represented as point in high dimensional feature space the key challenge of searching similar images from large database is the high computational overhead due to the curse of dimensionality reducing the dimensionality is an important means to tackle the problem in this paper we study dimensionality reduction for top image retrieval intuitively an effective dimensionality reduction method should not only preserve the close locations of similar images or points but also separate those dissimilar ones far apart in the reduced subspace existing dimensionality reduction methods mainly focused on the former we propose novel idea called locality condensation lc to not only preserve localities determined by neighborhood information and their global similarity relationship but also ensure that different localities will not invade each other in the low dimensional subspace to generate non overlapping localities in the subspace lc first performs an elliptical condensation which condenses each locality with an elliptical shape into more compact hypersphere to enlarge the margins among different localities and estimate the projection in the subspace for overlap analysis through convex optimization lc further performs scaling condensation on the obtained hyperspheres based on their projections in the subspace with minimal condensation degrees by condensing the localities effectively the potential overlaps among different localities in the low dimensional subspace are prevented consequently for similarity search in the subspace the number of false hits ie distant points that are falsely retrieved will be reduced extensive experimental comparisons with existing methods demonstrate the superiority of our proposal

recent advances in information technology demand handling complex data types such as images video audio time series and genetic sequences distinctly from traditional data such as numbers short strings and dates complex data do not possess the total ordering property yielding relational comparison operators useless even equality comparisons are of little help as it is very unlikely to have two complex elements exactly equal therefore the similarity among elements has emerged as the most important property for comparisons in such domains leading to the growing relevance of metric spaces to data search regardless of the data domain properties the systems need to track evolution of data over time when handling multidimensional data temporal information is commonly treated as just one or more dimensions however metric data do not have the concept of dimensions thus adding plain temporal dimension does not make sense in this paper we propose novel metric temporal data representation and exploit its properties to compare elements by similarity taking into account time related evolution we also present experimental evaluation which confirms that our technique effectively takes into account the contributions of both the metric and temporal data components moreover the experiments showed that the temporal information always improves the precision of the answer

abduction is fundamental form of nonmonotonic reasoning that aims at finding explanations for observed manifestations this process underlies many applications from car configuration to medical diagnosis we study here the computational complexity of deciding whether an explanation exists in the case when the application domain is described by propositional knowledge base building on previous results we classify the complexity for local restrictions on the knowledge base and under various restrictions on hypotheses and manifestations in comparison to the many previous studies on the complexity of abduction we are able to give much more detailed picture for the complexity of the basic problem of deciding the existence of an explanation it turns out that depending on the restrictions the problem in this framework is always polynomial time solvable np complete conp complete or complete based on these results we give an posteriori justification of what makes propositional abduction hard even for some classes of knowledge bases which allow for efficient satisfiability testing and deduction this justification is very simple and intuitive but it reveals that no nontrivial class of abduction problems is tractable indeed tractability essentially requires that the language for knowledge bases is unable to express both causal links and conflicts between hypotheses this generalizes similar observation by bylander et al for set covering abduction

requirements specification defines the requirements for the future system at conceptual level ie class or type level in contrast scenario represents concrete example of current or future system usage in early re phases scenarios are used to support the definition of high level requirements goals to be achieved by the new system in many cases those goals can to large degree be elicited by observing documenting and analyzing scenarios about current system usage ie the new system must often fulfill many of the functional and nonfunctional goals of the existing system to support the elicitation and validation of the goals achieved by the existing system and to illustrate problems of the old system we propose to capture current system usage using rich media eg video speech pictures etc and to interrelate those observations with the goal definitions thus we particularly aim at making the abstraction process which leads to the definition of the conceptual models more transparent and traceablemore precisely we relate the parts of the observations which have caused the definition of goal or against which goal was validated with the corresponding goal these interrelations provide the basis for explaining and illustrating goal model to eg untrained stakeholders and or new team members and thereby improving common understanding of the goal model detecting analyzing and resolving different interpretation of the observations comparing different observations using computed goal annotations and refining or detailing goal model during later process phases using the prime implementation framework we have implemented the prime crews environment which supports the interrelation of conceptual models and captured system usage observations we report on our experiences with prime crews gained in first experimental case study

modern software applications require internationalization to be distributed to different regions of the world in various situations many software applications are not internationalized at early stages of development to internationalize such an existing application developers need to externalize some hard coded constant strings to resource files so that translators can easily translate the application into local language without modifying its source code since not all the constant strings require externalization locating those need to translate constant strings is necessary task that developers must complete for internationalization in this paper we present an approach to automatically locating need to translate constant strings our approach first collects list of api methods related to the graphical user interface gui and then searches for need to translate strings from the invocations of these api methods based on string taint analysis we evaluated our approach on four real world open source applications rtext risk artofillusion and megamek the results show that our approach effectively locates most of the need to translate constant strings in all the four applications
we investigate design principles for placing striped delay sensitive data on number of disks in distributed environment the cost formulas of our performance model allow us to calculate the maximum number of users that can be supported by disks as well as to study the impact of other performance tuning options we show that for fixed probabilities of accessing the delay sensitive objects partitioning the set of disks is always better than striping in all of the disks then given number of disks and distinct delay sensitive objects with probabilities of access pr that must be striped across different disk partitions ie nonoverlapping subsets of the disks we use the theory of schur functions in order to find what is the optimal number of disks that must be allocated to each partition for objects with different consumption rates we provide an analytic solution to the problem of disk partitioning we analyze the problem of grouping the more and less popular delay sensitive objects together in partitions when the partitions are less than the objects so that the number of supported users is maximized finally we analyze the trade off of striping on all the disks versus partitioning the set of the disks when the access probabilities of the delay sensitive objects change with time

web cache replacement algorithms have received lot of attention during the past years though none of the proposed algorithms deals efficiently with all the particularities of the web environment namely relatively weak temporal locality due to filtering effects of caching hierarchies heterogeneity in size and origin of request streams in this paper we present the crf replacement policy whose development is mainly motivated by two factors the first is the filtering effects of web caching hierarchies and the second is the intention of achieving balance between hit and byte hit rates crf's decisions for replacement are based on combination of the recency and frequency criteria in way that requires no tunable parameters
data replication is key technique for ensuring data availability traditionally researchers have focused on the availability of individual objects even though user level tasks called operations typically request multiple objects our recent experimental study has shown that the assignment of object replicas to machines results in subtle yet dramatic effects on the availability of these operations even though the availability of individual objects remains the same this paper is the first to approach the assignment problem from theoretical perspective and obtains series of results regarding assignments that provide the best and the worst availability for user level operations we use range of techniques to obtain our results from standard combinatorial techniques and hill climbing methods to janson's inequality strong probabilistic tool some of the results demonstrate that even quite simple versions of the assignment problem can have surprising answers

project design involves an initial selection of technologies which has strong consequences for later stages of design in this paper we describe an ethnographic based field work study of complex organization and how it addressed the issue of front end project and technology selection formal procedures were designed for the organization to perform repeatable definable and measurable actions yet formal procedures obscured much about the processes actually being applied in selecting technologies and projects in actuality the formal procedures were interwoven with sensemaking activities so that technologies could be understood compared and decision consensus could be reached we expect that the insights from this study can benefit design teams in complex organizations facing similar selection and requirements issues
trust management represents today promising approach for supporting access control in open environments while several approaches have been proposed for trust management and significant steps have been made in this direction major obstacle that still exists in the realization of the benefits of this paradigm is represented by the lack of adequate support in the dbmsin this paper we present design that can be used to implement trust management within current relational dbmss we propose trust model with sql syntax and illustrate the main issues arising in the implementation of the model in relational dbms specific attention is paid to the efficient verification of delegation path for certificates this effort permits relatively inexpensive realization of the services of an advanced trust management model within current relational dbmss
constraints are important not just for maintaining data integrity but also because they capture natural probabilistic dependencies among data items probabilistic xml database pxdb is the probability sub space comprising the instances of document that satisfy set of constraints in contrast to existing models that can express probabilistic dependencies it is shown that query evaluation is tractable in pxdbs the problems of sampling and determining well definedness ie whether the above subspace is nonempty are also tractable furthermore queries and constraints can include the aggregate functions count max min and ratio finally this approach can be easily extended to allow probabilistic interpretation of constraints

we address the problem of proving the total correctness of transformations of definite logic programs we consider general transformation rule called clause replacement which consists in transforming program into new program by replacing set of clauses occurring in by new set of clauses provided that and are equivalent in the least herbrand model of the program pwe propose general method for proving that transformations based on clause replacement are totally correct that is our method consists in showing that the transformation of into can be performed by adding extra arguments to predicates thereby deriving from the given program an annotated program overline ii applying variant of the clause replacement rule and transforming the annotated program overline into terminating annotated program overline and iii erasing the annotations from overline thereby getting qour method does not require that either or are terminating and it is parametric with respect to the annotations by providing different annotations we can easily prove the total correctness of program transformations based on various versions of the popular unfolding folding and goal replacement rules which can all be viewed as particular cases of our clause replacement rule
fundamental natural interaction concept is not yet fully exploited in most of the existing human computer interfaces recent technological advances have created the possibility to naturally and significantly enhance the interface perception by means of visual inputs the so called vision based interaction vbi in this paper we present gesture recognition algorithm where the user's movements are obtained through real time vision based motion capture system specifically we focus on recognizing users motions with particular mean that is gesture defining an appropriate representation of the user's motions based on temporal posture parameterization we apply non parametric techniques to learn and recognize the user's gestures in real time this scheme of recognition has been tested for controlling classical computer videogame the results obtained show an excellent performance in on line classification and it allows the possibility to achieve learning phase in real time due to its computational simplicity
in an attempt to cope with time varying workload traditional adaptive time warp protocols are designed to react in response to performance changes by altering control parameter configurations like the amount of available memory the size of the checkpointing interval the frequency of gvt computation fossil collection invocations etc we call those schemes reactive because all control decisions are undertaken based on historical performance information collected at runtime and come into effect in future system states what must be considered drawback of this class of approaches is that time warp logical processes lps have most likely reached state different from the one for which the control action was established thus inducing performance control activities which are always outdatedthis paper develops environment aware self adaptive time warp lps implementing pro active performance control scheme addressing the timeliness of control decisions opposed to reactive tw schemes our pro active control mechanism based on statistical analysis of the state history periodically collected in real time intervals of size forecasts future lp state performance control decision is established that is most appropriate for the expected future lp state ie the state when the corresponding control activity would become effective depending on the forecast quality pro active scheme will presumably exhibit performance superior to re active schemes at least for cases where state changes in the time frame delta are very likely in this paper we study the ability of pro active tw lps to adapt to sudden load changes especially to abruptly occurring background workloads injected by other applications executing concurrently with the tw simulation on network of workstations experimental results show that the protocol is able to capture abrupt changes in both computational and communication resource availability justifying the title shock resistant time warp
multiresolution meshes enable us to build representations of geometric objects at different levels of detail lods we introduce multiresolution scheme whose data structure allows us to separately restore the geometry and topology of mesh during the refinement process additionally we use topological criterion not geometric criterion as usual in the literature to quickly simplify mesh what seems to make the corresponding simplification algorithm adequate for real time applications such as for example on line computer games
recent progress in energy harvesting technologies made it possible to build sensor networks with rechargeable nodes which target an indefinitely long operation in these networks the goal of energy management is to allocate the available energy such that the important performance metrics such as the number of detected threats are maximized as the harvested energy is not sufficient for continuous operation the scheduling of the active and inactive time is one of the main components of energy management the active time scheduling protocols need to maintain the energy equilibrium of the nodes while considering the uncertainties of the energy income which is strongly influenced by the weather and the energy expenditures which are dependent on the behavior of the targets in this paper we describe and experimentally compare three active time scheduling protocols static active time dynamic active time based on multi parameter heuristic and utility based uniform sensing we show that protocols which take into consideration the probabilistic models of the energy income and expenditure and can dynamically adapt to changes in the environment can provide significant performance advantage
so far virtual machine vm migration has focused on transferring the run time memory state of the vms in local area networks lan however for wide area network wan migration it is crucial to not just transfer the vms image but also transfer its local persistent state its file system and its on going network connections in this paper we address both by combining block level solution with pre copying and write throttling we show that we can transfer an entire running web server including its local persistent state with minimal disruption three seconds in the lan and seconds in the wan by combining dyndns with tunneling existing connections can continue transparently while new ones are redirected to the new network location thus we show experimentally that by combining well known techniques in novel manner we can provide system support for migrating virtual execution environments in the wide area
communication set generation significantly influences the performance of parallel programs however studies seldom give attention to the problem of communication set generation for irregular applications in this paper we propose communication optimization techniques for the situation of irregular array references in nested loops in our methods the local array distribution schemes are determined so that the total number of communication messages is minimized then we explain how to support communication set generation at compile time by introducing some symbolic analysis techniques in our symbolic analysis symbolic solutions of set of symbolic expression are obtained by using certain restrictions we introduce symbolic analysis algorithms to obtain the solutions in terms of set of equalities and inequalities finally experimental results on parallel computer cm are presented to validate our approach
the successful deployment of security policy is closely related not only to the complexity of the security requirements but also to the capabilities functionalities of the security devices the complexity of the security requirements is additionally increased when contextual constraints are taken into account such situations appear when addressing the dynamism of some security requirements or when searching finer granularity for the security rules the context denotes those specific conditions in which the security requirements are to be met re deploying contextual security policy depends on the security device functionalities either the devices include all functionalities necessary to deal with context and the policy is consequently deployed for ensuring its automatic changes or the devices do not have the right functionalities to entirely interpret contextual requirement we present solution to cope with this issue the re deployment of access control policies in system that lacks the necessary functionalities to deal with contexts
memory management is critical issue in stream processing involving stateful operators such as join traditionally the memory requirement for stream join is query driven query has to explicitly define window for each potentially unbounded input the window essentially bounds the size of the buffer allocated for that stream however output produced this way may not be desirable if the window size is not part of the intended query semantic due to the volatile input characteristics we discover that when streams are ordered or partially ordered it is possible to use data driven memory management scheme to improve the performance in this work we present novel data driven memory management scheme called window oblivious join wo join which adaptively adjusts the state buffer size according to the input characteristics our performance study shows that compared to traditional window join join wo join is more robust with respect to the dynamic input and therefore produces higher quality results with lower memory costs

multicast is one of the most frequently used collective communication operations in multi core soc platforms bus as the traditional interconnect architecture for soc development has been highly efficient in delivering multicast messages since the bus is non scalable it can not address the bandwidth requirements of the large socs the networks on chip nocs emerged as scalable alternative to address the increasing communication demands of such systems however due to its hop to hop communication the nocs may not be able to deliver multicast operations as efficiently as buses do adopting multi port routers has been an approach to improve the performance of the multicast operations in interconnection networks this paper presents novel analytical model to compute communication latency of the multicast operation in wormhole routed interconnection networks employing asynchronous multi port routers scheme the model is applied to the quarc noc and its validity is verified by comparing the model predictions against the results obtained from discrete event simulator developed using omnet
queries that return list of frequently occurring items are important in the analysis of real time internet packet streams while several results exist for computing top queries using limited memory in the infinite stream model eg limited memory sliding windows to compute the statistics over sliding window synopsis data structure can be maintained for the stream to compute the statistics rapidly usually top query is always processed over an equal synopsis but it's very hard to implement over an unequal synopsis because of the resulting inaccurate approximate answers therefore in this paper we focus on periodically refreshed top queries over sliding windows on internet traffic streams we present deterministic dsw dynamic sub window algorithm to support the processing of top aggregate queries over an unequal synopsis and guarantee the accuracy of the approximation results
concurrent ml cml is statically typed higher order concurrent language that is embedded in standard ml its most notable feature is its support for first class synchronous operations this mechanism allows programmers to encapsulate complicated communication and synchronization protocols as first class abstractions which encourages modular style of programming where the underlying channels used to communicate with given thread are hidden behind data and type abstractionwhile cml has been in active use for well over decade little attention has been paid to optimizing cml programs in this paper we present new program analysis for statically typed higher order concurrent languages that enables the compile time specialization of communication operations this specialization is particularly important in multiprocessor or multicore setting where the synchronization overhead for general purpose operations are high preliminary results from prototype that we have built demonstrate that specialized channel operations are much faster than the general purpose operationsour analysis technique is modular ie it analyzes and optimizes single unit of abstraction at time which plays to the modular style of many cml programs the analysis consists of three steps the first is type sensitive control flow analysis that uses the program's type abstractions to compute more precise results the second is the construction of an extended control flow graph using the results of the cfa the last step is an iterative analysis over the graph that approximates the usage patterns of known channels our analysis is designed to detect special patterns of use such as one shot channels fan in channels and fan out channels we have proven the safety of our analysis and state those results

we introduce spidercast distributed protocol for constructing scalable churn resistant overlay topologies for supporting decentralized topic based pub sub communication spidercast is designed to effectively tread the balance between average overlay degree and communication cost of event dissemination it employs novel coverage optimizing heuristic in which the nodes utilize partial subscription views provided by decentralized membership service to reduce the average node degree while guaranteeing with high probability that the events posted on each topic can be routed solely through the nodes interested in this topic in other words the overlay is topic connected spidercast is unique in maintaining an overlay topology that scales well with the average number of topics node is subscribed to assuming the subscriptions are correlated insofar as found in most typical workloads furthermore the degree grows logarithmically in the total number of topics and slowly decreases as the number of nodes increases we show experimentally that for many practical work loads the spidercast overlays are both topic connected and have low per topic diameter while requiring each node to maintain low average number of connections these properties are satisfied even in very large settings involving up to nodes topics and subscriptions per node and under high churn rates in addition our results demonstrate that in large setting the average node degree in spidercast is at least smaller than in other overlays typically used to support decentralized pub sub communication such as eg similarity based rings based and random overlays

the accuracy of methods for the assessment of mammographic risk analysis is heavily related to breast tissue characteristics previous work has demonstrated considerable success in developing an automatic breast tissue classification methodology which overcomes this difficulty this paper proposes unified approach for the application of number of rough and fuzzy rough set methods to the analysis of mammographic data indeed this is the first time that fuzzy rough approaches have been applied to this particular problem domain in the unified approach detailed here feature selection methods are employed for dimensionality reduction developed using rough sets and fuzzy rough sets number of classifiers are then used to examine the data reduced by the feature selection approaches and assess the positive impact of these methods on classification accuracy additionally this paper also employs new fuzzy rough classifier based on the nearest neighbour classification algorithm the novel use of such an approach demonstrates its efficiency in improving classification accuracy for mammographic data as well as considerably removing redundant irrelevant and noisy features this is supported with experimental application to two well known datasets the overall result of employing the proposed unified approach is that feature selection can identify only those features which require extraction this can have the positive effect of increasing the risk assessment accuracy rate whilst additionally reducing the time required for expert scrutiny which in turn means the risk analysis process is potentially quicker and involves less screening
many complex analysis problems can be most clearly and easily specified as logic rules and queries where rules specify how given facts can be combined to infer new facts and queries select facts of interest to the analysis problem at hand however it has been extremely challenging to obtain efficient implementations from logic rules and to understand their time and space complexities especially for on demand analysis driven by queriesthis paper describes powerful method for generating specialized rules and programs for demand driven analysis from datalog rules and queries and further for providing time and space complexity guarantees the method combines recursion conversion with specialization of rules and then uses method for program generation and complexity calculation from rules we compare carefully with the best prior methods by examining many variants of rules and queries for the same graph reachability problems and show the application of our method in implementing graph query languages in general
understanding the intent underlying user's queries may help personalize search results and therefore improve user satisfaction we develop methodology for using the content of search engine result pages serps along with the information obtained from query strings to study characteristics of query intent with particular focus on sponsored search this work represents an initial step towards the development and evaluation of an ontology for commercial search considering queries that reference specific products brands and retailers the characteristics of query categories are studied with respect to aggregated user's clickthrough behavior on advertising links we present model for clickthrough behavior that considers the influence of such factors as the location of ads and the rank of ads along with query category we evaluate our work using large corpus of clickthrough data obtained from major commercial search engine our findings suggest that query based features along with the content of serps are effective in detecting query intent the clickthrough behavior is found to be consistent with the classification for the general categories of query intent while for product brand and retailer categories all is true to lesser extent
advances in wireless and mobile computing environments allow mobile user to access wide range of applications for example mobile users may want to retrieve data about unfamiliar places or local life styles related to their location these queries are called location dependent queries furthermore mobile user may be interested in getting the query results repeatedly which is called location dependent continuous querying this continuous query emanating from mobile user may retrieve information from single zone single zq or from multiple neighbouring zones multiple zq we consider the problem of handling location dependent continuous queries with the main emphasis on reducing communication costs and making sure that the user gets correct current query result the key contributions of this paper include proposing hierarchical database framework tree architecture and supporting continuous query algorithm for handling location dependent continuous queries analysing the flexibility of this framework for handling queries related to single zq or multiple zq and propose intelligent selective placement of location dependent databases proposing an intelligent selective replication algorithm to facilitate time and space efficient processing of location dependent continuous queries retrieving single zq information demonstrating using simulation the significance of our intelligent selective placement and selective replication model in terms of communication cost and storage constraints considering various types of queries
studies have shown that for significant fraction of the time workstations are idle in this paper we present new scheduling policy called linger longer that exploits the fine grained availability of workstations to run sequential and parallel jobs we present two level workload characterization study and use it to simulate cluster of workstations running our new policy we compare two variations of our policy to two previous policies immediate eviction and pause and migrate our study shows that the linger longer policy can improve the throughput of foreign jobs on cluster by percent with only percent slowdown of local jobs for parallel computing we show that the linger longer policy outperforms reconfiguration strategies when the processor utilization by the local process is percent or less in both synthetic bulk synchronous and real data parallel applications
protection of one's intellectual property is topic with important technological and legal facets the significance of this issue is amplified nowadays due to the ease of data dissemination through the internet here we provide technological mechanisms for establishing the ownership of dataset consisting of multiple objects the objects that we consider in this work are shapes ie two dimensional contours which abound in disciplines such as medicine biology anthropology and natural sciences the protection of the dataset is achieved through means of embedding of an imperceptible ownership seal that imparts only minute visual distortions this seal needs to be embedded in the proper data space so that its removal or destruction is particularly difficult our technique is robust to many common transformations such as data rotation translation scaling noise addition and resampling in addition to that the proposed scheme also guarantees that important distances between the dataset shapes objects are not distorted we achieve this by preserving the geodesic distances between the dataset objects geodesic distances capture significant part of the dataset structure and their usefulness is recognized in many machine learning visualization and clustering algorithms therefore if practitioner uses the protected dataset as input to variety of mining machine learning or database operations the output will be the same as on the original dataset we illustrate and validate the applicability of our methods on image shapes extracted from anthropological and natural science data
we describe parallel real time garbage collector and present experimental results that demonstrate good scalability and good real time bounds the collector is designed for shared memory multiprocessors and is based on an earlier collector algorithm which provided fixed bounds on the time any thread must pause for collection however since our earlier algorithm was designed for simple analysis it had some impractical features this paper presents the extensions necessary for practical implementation reducing excessive interleaving handling stacks and global variables reducing double allocation and special treatment of large and small objects an implementation based on the modified algorithm is evaluated on set of sml benchmarks on sun enterprise way ultrasparc ii multiprocessor to the best of our knowledge this is the first implementation of parallel real time garbage collector the average collector speedup is at processors and at processors maximum pause times range from ms to ms in contrast non incremental collector whether generational or not has maximum pause times from ms to ms compared to non parallel stop copy collector parallelism has overhead while real time behavior adds an additional overhead since the collector takes about of total execution time these features have an overall time costs of and
distributed applications have become core component of the internet's infrastructure however many undergraduate curriculums especially at small colleges do not offer courses that focus on the design and implementation of distributed systems the courses that are offered address the theoretical aspects of system design but often fail to provide students with the opportunity to develop and evaluate distributed applications in real world environments as result undergraduate students are not as prepared as they should be for graduate study or careers in industry this paper describes an undergraduate course in distributed systems that not only studies the key design principles of distributed systems but also has unique emphasis on giving students hands on access to distributed systems through the use of shared computing testbeds such as planetlab and geni and open source technologies such as xen and hadoop using these platforms students can perform large scale distributed experimentation even at small colleges
network architectures for collaborative virtual reality have traditionally been dominated by client server and peer to peer approaches with peer to peer strategies typically being favored where minimizing latency is priority and client server where consistency is key with increasingly sophisticated behavior models and the demand for better support for haptics we argue that neither approach provides sufficient support for these scenarios and thus hybrid architecture is required we discuss the relative performance of different distribution strategies in the face of real network conditions and illustrate the problems they face finally we present an architecture that successfully meets many of these challenges and demonstrate its use in distributed virtual prototyping application which supports simultaneous collaboration for assembly maintenance and training applications utilizing haptics
we describe new application controlled file persistence model in which applications select the desired stability from range of persistence guarantees this new abstraction extends conventional abstractions by allowing applications to specify file's volatility and methods for automatic reconstruction in case of loss the model allows applications particularly ones with weak persistence requirements to leverage the memory space of other machines to improve their performance an automated filename matching interface permits legacy applications to take advantage of the variable persistence guarantees without being modified our prototype implementation shows significant speed ups in some cases more than an order of magnitude over conventional network file systems such as nfs version
data caches are key hardware means to bridge the gap between processor and memory speeds but only for programs that exhibit sufficient data locality in their memory accesses thus method for evaluating cache performance is required to both determine quantitatively cache misses and to guide data cache optimizations existing analytical models for data cache optimizations target mainly isolated perfect loop nests we present an analytical model that is capable of statically analyzing not only loop nest fragments but also complete numerical programs with regular and compile time predictable memory accesses central to the whole program approach are abstract call inlining memory access vectors and parametric reuse analysis which allow the reuse and interference both within and across loop nests to be quantified precisely in unified framework based on the framework the cache misses of program are specified using mathematical formulas and the miss ratio is predicted from these formulas based on statistical sampling techniques our experimental results using kernels and whole programs indicate accurate cache miss estimates in substantially shorter amount of time typically several orders of magnitude faster than simulation
indexes are commonly employed to retrieve portion of file or to retrieve its records in particular order an accurate performance model of indexes is essential to the design analysis and tuning of file management and database systems and particularly to database query optimization many previous studies have addressed the problem of estimating the number of disk page fetches when randomly accessing records out of given records stored on disk pages this paper generalizes these results relaxing two assumptions that usually do not hold in practice unlimited buffer and unique records for each key value experiments show that the performance of an index scan is very sensitive to buffer size limitations and multiple records per key value model for these more practical situations is presented and formula derived for estimating the performance of an index scan we also give closed form approximation that is easy to compute the theoretical results are validated using the distributed relational database system although we use database terminology throughout the paper the model is more generally applicable whenever random accesses are made using keys
visibility problems are central to many computer graphics applications the most common examples include hidden part removal for view computation shadow boundaries mutual visibility of objects for lighting simulation in this paper we present theoretical study of visibility properties for scenes of smooth convex objects we work in the space of light rays or more precisely of maximal free segments we group segments that see the same object this defines the visibility complex the boundaries of these groups of segments correspond to the visual events of the scene limits of shadows disappearance of an object when the viewpoint is moved etc we provide worst case analysis of the complexity of the visibility complex of scenes as well as probabilistic study under simple assumption for normal scenes we extend the visibility complex to handle temporal visibility we give an output sensitive construction algorithm and present applications of our approach
wireless sensor network wsn design is complicated by the interaction of three elements localization medium access control and routing the design of wireless sensor networks necessarily focuses on the network's intended purpose as well as an understanding of the synergies and tradeoffs between each of these three elements we propose five guidelines for the development of wireless sensor network and the performance and suitability of several protocols and algorithms are examined with respect to those guidelines we also suggest several performance metrics to provide fair comparisons between various localization medium access control and routing protocols
while the past research discussed several advantages of multiprocessor system on chip mpsoc architectures from both area utilization and design verification perspectives over complex single core based systems compilation issues for these architectures have relatively received less attention programming mpsocs can be challenging as several potentially conflicting issues such as data locality parallelism and load balance across processors should be considered simultaneously most of the compilation techniques discussed in the literature for parallel architectures not necessarily for mpsocs are loop based ie they consider each loop nest in isolation however one key problem associated with such loop based techniques is that they fail to capture the interactions between the different loop nests in the application this paper takes more global approach to the problem and proposes compiler driven data locality optimization strategy in the context of embedded mpsocs an important characteristic of the proposed approach is that in deciding the workloads of the processors ie in parallelizing the application it considers all the loop nests in the application simultaneously our experimental evaluation with eight embedded applications shows that the global scheme brings significant power performance benefits over the conventional loop based scheme
we propose new real time authentication scheme for memory as in previous proposals the scheme uses merkle tree to guarantee dynamic protection of memory we use the universal hash function family nh for speed and couple it with an aes encryption in order to achieve high level of security the proposed scheme is much faster compared to similar schemes achieved by cryptographic hash functions such as sha due to the finer grain incremental hashing ability provided by nh this advantage in speed becomes more vivid when the frequency of integrity checks becomes much lower than the frequency of memory updating this feature is mainly due to the incremental nature of nh moreover we show that with small variation in the universal hash function family used we can achieve fast and simple software implementation
query optimizer compares alternative plans in its search space to find the best plan for given query depending on the search space and the enumeration algorithm optimizers vary in their compilation time and the quality of the execution plan they can generate this paper describes compilation time estimator that provides quantified estimate of the optimizer compilation time for given query such an estimator is useful for automatically choosing the right level of optimization in commercial database systems in addition compilation time estimates can be quite helpful for mid query reoptimization for monitoring the progress of workload analysis tools where large number queries need to be compiled but not executed and for judicious design and tuning of an optimizerprevious attempts to estimate optimizer compilation complexity used the number of possible binary joins as the metric and overlooked the fact that each join often translates into different number of join plans because of the presence of physical properties we use the number of plans instead of joins to estimate query compilation time and employ two novel ideas reusing an optimizer's join enumerator to obtain actual number of joins but bypassing plan generation to save estimation overhead maintaining small number of interesting properties to facilitate plan counting we prototyped our approach in commercial database system and our experimental results show that we can achieve good compilation time estimates less than error on average for complex real queries using small fraction within of the actual compilation time
iterative compilation is an efficient approach to optimize programs on rapidly evolving hardware but it is still only scarcely used in practice due to necessity to gather large number of runs often with the same data set and on the same environment in order to test many different optimizations and to select the most appropriate ones naturally in many cases users cannot afford training phase will run each data set once develop new programs which are not yet known and may regularly change the environment the programs are run onin this article we propose to overcome that practical obstacle using collective optimization where the task of optimizing program leverages the experience of many other users rather than being performed in isolation and often redundantly by each user collective optimization is an unobtrusive approach where performance information obtained after each run is sent back to central database which is then queried for optimizations suggestions and the program is then recompiled accordingly we show that it is possible to learn across data sets programs and architectures in non dynamic environments using static function cloning and run time adaptation without even reference run to compute speedups over the baseline optimization we also show that it is possible to simultaneously learn and improve performance since there are no longer two separate training and test phases as in most studies we demonstrate that extensively relying on competition among pairs of optimizations program reaction to optimizations provides robust and efficient method for capturing the impact of optimizations and for reusing this knowledge across data sets programs and environments we implemented our approach in gcc and will publicly disseminate it in the near future
this paper describes memory discipline that combines region based memory management and copying garbage collection by extending cheney's copying garbage collection algorithm to work with regions the paper presents empirical evidence that region inference very significantly reduces the number of garbage collections and evidence that the fastest execution is obtained by using regions alone without garbage collection the memory discipline is implemented for standard ml in the ml kit compiler and measurements show that for variety of benchmark programs code generated by the compiler is as efficient both with respect to execution time and memory usage as programs compiled with standard ml of new jersey another state of the art standard ml compiler

embedded digital signal processors for software defined radio have stringent design constraints including high computational bandwidth low power consumption and low interrupt latency furthermore due to rapidly evolving communication standards with increasing code complexity these processors must be compiler friendly so that code for them can quickly be developed in high level language in this paper we present the design of the sandblaster processor low power multithreaded digital signal processor for software defined radio the processor uses unique combination of token triggered threading powerful compound instructions and simd vector operations to provide real time baseband processing capabilities with very low power consumption we describe the processor's architecture and microarchitecture along with various techniques for achieving high performance and low power dissipation we also describe the processor's programming environment and the sb platform complete system on chip solution for software defined radio using super computer class vectorizing compiler the sb achieves real time performance in software on variety of communication protocols including gps am fm radio bluetooth gprs and wcdma in addition to providing programmable platform for sdr the processor also provides efficient support for wide variety of digital signal processing and multimedia applications
the logic programming paradigm provides the basis for new intensional view of higher order notions this view is realized primarily by employing the terms of typed lambda calculus as representational devices and by using richer form of unification for probing their structures these additions have important meta programming applications but they also pose non trivial implementation problems one issue concerns the machine representation of lambda terms suitable to their intended use an adequate encoding must facilitate comparison operations over terms in addition to supporting the usual reduction computation another aspect relates to the treatment of unification operation that has branching character and that sometimes calls for the delaying of the solution of unification problems final issue concerns the execution of goals whose structures become apparent only in the course of computation these various problems are exposed in this paper and solutions to them are described satisfactory representation for lambda terms is developed by exploiting the nameless notation of de bruijn as well as explicit encodings of substitutions special mechanisms are molded into the structure of traditional prolog implementations to support branching in unification and carrying of unification problems over other computation steps premium is placed in this context on exploiting determinism and on emulating usual first order behaviour an extended compilation model is presented that treats higher order unification and also handles dynamically emergent goals the ideas described here have been employed in the teyjus implementation of the lambda prolog language fact that is used to obtain preliminary assessment of their efficacy
new directions in the provision of end user computing experiences mean that we need to determine the best way to share data between small mobile computing devices partitioning large structures so that they can be shared efficiently provides basis for data intensive applications on such platforms in conjunction with such an approach dictionary based compression techniques provide additional benefits and help to prolong battery life
there has been wide interest recently in managing probabilistic data but in order to follow the rich literature on probabilistic databases one is often required to take detour into probability theory correlations conditionals monte carlo simulations error bounds topics that have been studied extensively in several areas of computer science and mathematics because of that it is often difficult to get to the algorithmic and systems level aspects of probabilistic data management in this tutorial we will distill these aspects from the often theory heavy literature on probabilistic databases we will start by describing real application at the university of washington using the rfid ecosystem we will show how probabilities arise naturally and why we need to cope with them we will then describe what an implementor needs to know to process sql queries on probabilistic databases in the second half of the tutorial we will discuss more advanced issues such as event processing over probabilistic streams and views over probabilistic data
specifications that are used in detailed design and in the documentation of existing code are primarily written and read by programmers however most formal specification languages either make heavy use of symbolic mathematical operators which discourages use by programmers or limit assertions to expressions of the underlying programming language which makes it difficult to write exact specifications moreover using assertions that are expressions in the underlying programming language can cause problems both in runtime assertion checking and in formal verification because such expressions can potentially contain side effects the java modeling language jml avoids these problems it uses side effect free subset of java's expressions to which are added few mathematical operators such as the quantifiers forall and exists jml also hides mathematical abstractions such as sets and sequences within library of java classes the goal is to allow jml to serve as common notation for both formal verification and runtime assertion checking this gives users the benefit of several tools without the cost of changing notations
data caching on mobile clients is widely seen as an effective solution to improve system performance in particular cooperative caching based on the idea of sharing and coordination of cache data among multiple users can be particularly effective for information access in mobile ad hoc networks where mobile clients are moving frequently and network topology is changing dynamically most existing cache strategies perform replacement independently and they seldom consider coordinated replacement and energy saving issues in the context of mobile ad hoc network in this paper we analyse the impact of energy on designing cache replacement policy and formulate the energy efficient coordinated cache replacement problem ecorp as knapsack problem dynamic programming algorithm called ecorp dp and heuristic algorithm called ecorp greedy are presented to solve the problem simulations using both synthetic workload traces and real workload traces in our experiments show that the proposed policies can significantly reduce energy consumption and access latency when compared to other replacement policies
human participation in business processes needs to be addressed in process modeling bpelpeople with ws humantask covers this concern in the context of bpel bound to specific workflow technology this leads to number of problems firstly maintaining and migrating processes to new or similar technologies is expensive secondly the low level technical standards make it hard to communicate the process models to human domain experts model driven approaches can help to easier cope with technology changes and present the process models at higher level of abstraction than offered by the technology standards in this paper we extend the model driven approach with view based framework for business process modeling in which models can be viewed at different abstraction levels and different concerns of model can be viewed separately our approach enables developers to work with meta models that represent technical view on the human participation whereas human domain experts can have an abstract view on human participation in business process in order to validate our work mapping to bpelpeople technology will be demonstrated
large datasets on the order of gb and tb are increasingly common as abundant computational resources allow practitioners to collect produce and store data at higher rates as dataset sizes grow it becomes more challenging to interactively manipulate and analyze these datasets due to the large amounts of data that need to be moved and processed application independent caches such as operating system page caches and database buffer caches are present throughout the memory hierarchy to reduce data access times and alleviate transfer overheads we claim that an application aware cache with relatively modest memory requirements can effectively exploit dataset structure and application information to speed access to large datasets we demonstrate this idea in the context of system named the tree cache to reduce query latency to large octree datasets by an order of magnitude
mobile devices have become indispensable in daily life and hence how to take advantage of these portable and powerful facilities to share resources and information begins to emerge as an interesting problem in this paper we investigate the problem of information retrieval in mobile peer to peer network the prevailing approach to information retrieval is to apply flooding methods because of its quick response and easy maintenance obviously this kind of approach wastes huge amount of communication bandwidth which greatly affects the availability of the network and the battery power which significantly shortens the serving time of mobile devices in the network to tackle this problem we propose novel approach by mimicking different human behaviors of social networks which takes advantages of intelligence accuracy ia mechanism that evaluates the distance from node to certain resources in the network extensive experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach as well as its scalability in volatile environment

the formation of secure transportation corridors where cargoes and shipments from points of entry can be dispatched safely to highly sensitive and secure locations is high national priority one of the key tasks of the program is the detection of anomalous cargo based on sensor readings in truck weigh stations due to the high variability dimensionality and or noise content of sensor data in transportation corridors appropriate feature representation is crucial to the success of anomaly detection methods in this domain in this paper we empirically investigate the usefulness of manifold embedding methods for feature representation in anomaly detection problems in the domain of transportation corridors we focus on both linear methods such as multi dimensional scaling mds as well as nonlinear methods such as locally linear embedding lle and isometric feature mapping isomap our study indicates that such embedding methods provide natural mechanism for keeping anomalous points away from the dense normal regions in the embedding of the data we illustrate the efficacy of manifold embedding methods for anomaly detection through experiments on simulated data as well as real truck data from weigh stations

with advances in process technology soft errors se are becoming an increasingly critical design concern due to their large area and high density caches are worst hit by soft errors although error correction code based mechanisms protect the data in caches they have high performance and power overheads since multimedia applications are increasingly being used in mission critical embedded systems where both reliability and energy are major concern there is de nite need to improve reliability in embedded systems without too much energy overhead we observe that while soft error in multimedia data may only result in minor loss in qos soft error in avariable that controls the execution ow of the program may be fatal consequently we propose to partition the data space into failure critical and failure non critical data and provide high degree of soft error protection only to the failure critical data in horizontally partitioned caches experimental results demonstrate that our selective data protection can achieve the failure rate close to that of soft error protected cache system while retaining the performance and energy consumption similar to those of traditional cache system with some degradation in qos for example for conventional con guration as in intelxscale our approach achieves the same failure rate while improving performance by and reducing energy consumption by in comparison with soft error protected cache
when ranking texts retrieved for query semantics of each term in the texts is fundamental basis the semantics often depends on locality context neighboring terms of in the texts in this paper we present technique ctfatr that improves text rankers by encoding the term locality contexts to the assessment of term frequency tf of each term in the texts results of the tf assessment may be directly used to improve various kinds of text rankers without calling for any revisions to algorithms and development processes of the rankers moreover ctfatr is efficient to conduct the tf assessment online and neither training process nor training data is required empirical evaluation shows that ctfatr significantly improves various kinds of text rankers the contributions are of practical significance since many text rankers were developed and if they consider tf in ranking ctfatr may be used to enhance their performance without incurring any cost to them
this paper presents capriccio scalable thread package for use with high concurrency servers while recent work has advocated event based systems we believe that thread based systems can provide simpler programming model that achieves equivalent or superior performanceby implementing capriccio as user level thread package we have decoupled the thread package implementation from the underlying operating system as result we can take advantage of cooperative threading new asynchronous mechanisms and compiler support using this approach we are able to provide three key features scalability to threads efficient stack management and resource aware schedulingwe introduce linked stack management which minimizes the amount of wasted stack space by providing safe small and non contiguous stacks that can grow or shrink at run time compiler analysis makes our stack implementation efficient and sound we also present resource aware scheduling which allows thread scheduling and admission control to adapt to the system's current resource usage this technique uses blocking graph that is automatically derived from the application to describe the flow of control between blocking points in cooperative thread package we have applied our techniques to the apache web server demonstrating that we can achieve high performance and scalability despite using simple threaded programming model

bounded treewidth and monadic second order mso logic have proved to be key concepts in establishing fixed para meter tractability results indeed by courcelle's theorem we know any property of finite structures which is expressible by an mso sentence can be decided in linear time data complexity if the structures have bounded treewidth in principle courcelle's theorem can be applied directly to construct concrete algorithms by transforming the mso evaluation problem into tree language recognition problem the latter can then be solved via finite tree automaton fta however this approach has turned out to be problematical since even relatively simple mso formulae may lead to state explosion of the fta in this work we propose monadic datalog ie data log where all intentional predicate symbols are unary as an alternative method to tackle this class of fixed parameter tractable problems we show that if some property of finite structures is expressible in mso then this property can also be expressed by means of monadic datalog program over the structure plus the treedecomposition moreover we show that the resulting fragment of datalogcan be evaluated in linear time both wrt the program size and wrt the data size this new approach is put to work by devising new algorithm for the primality problem ie testing if some attribute in relational schema is part of key we also report on experimental results with prototype implementation

classification of head models based on their shape attributes for subsequent indexing and retrieval are important in many applications as in hierarchical content based retrieval of these head models for virtual scene composition and the automatic annotation of these characters in such scenes while simple feature representations are preferred for more efficient classification operations these features may not be adequate for distinguishing between the subtly different head model classes in view of these we propose an optimization approach based on genetic algorithm ga where the original model representation is transformed in such way that the classification rate is significantly enhanced while retaining the efficiency and simplicity of the original representation specifically based on the extended gaussian image egi representation for models which summarizes the surface normal orientation statistics we consider these orientations as random variables and proceed to search for an optimal transformation for these variables based on genetic optimization the resulting transformed distributions for these random variables are then used as the modified classifier inputs experiments have shown that the optimized transformation results in significant improvement in classification results for large variety of class structures more importantly the transformation can be indirectly realized by bin removal and bin count merging in the original histogram thus retaining the advantage of the original egi representation
many distributed applications have to meet their performance or quality of service goals in environments where available resources change contantly important classes of distributed applications including distributed multimedia codes applications for mobile devices and computational grid codes use runtime adaptation in order to achieve their goals the adaptation behavior in these applications is usually programmed in ad hoc code that is directly incorporated into the base application resulting in systems that are complex to develop maintain modify and debug furthermore it is virtually impossible to extract high level information about adaptive behaviour using program analysis even if there were compiler and runtime sytems that could exploit such information the goal of our research is to develop compiler and programming language support to simplify the development and improve the performance of adaptive distribtued applications we describe simple set of language extensions for adaptive distributed applications and discuss potential compiler techniqes to support such appliations we also propose task graph based framework that can be used to formalize the description of wide range of adaptation operations

mobile users of computation and communication services have been rapidly adopting battery powered mobile handhelds such as pocketpcs and smartphones for their work however the limited battery lifetime of these devices restricts their portability and applicability and this weakness can be exacerbated by mobile malware targeting depletion of battery energy such malware are usually difficult to detect and prevent and frequent outbreaks of new malware variants also reduce the effectiveness of commonly seen signature based detection to alleviate these problems we propose power aware malware detection framework that monitors detects and analyzes previously unknown energy depletion threats the framework is composed of power monitor which collects power samples and builds power consumption history from the collected samples and data analyzer which generates power signature from the constructed history to generate power signature simple and effective noise filtering and data compression are applied thus reducing the detection overhead similarities between power signatures are measured by the distance reducing both false positive and false negative detection rates according to our experimental results on an hp ipaq running windows mobile os the proposed framework achieves significant up to storage savings without losing the detection accuracy and true positive rate in classifying mobile malware
we present an algorithm for the layered segmentation of video data in multiple views the approach is based on computing the parameters of layered representation of the scene in which each layer is modelled by its motion appearance and occupancy where occupancy describes probabilistically the layer's spatial extent and not simply its segmentation in particular view the problem is formulated as the map estimation of all layer parameters conditioned on those at the previous time step ie sequential estimation problem that is equivalent to tracking multiple objects in given number views expectation maximisation is used to establish layer posterior probabilities for both occupancy and visibility which are represented distinctly evidence from areas in each view which are described poorly under the model is used to propose new layers automatically since these potential new layers often occur at the fringes of images the algorithm is able to segment and track these in single view until such time as suitable candidate match is discovered in the other views the algorithm is shown to be very effective at segmenting and tracking non rigid objects and can cope with extreme occlusion we demonstrate an application of this representation to dynamic novel view synthesis
one of the critiques on program slicing is that slices presented to the user are hard to understand this is mainly related to the problem that slicing lsquo dumps rsquo the results onto the user without any explanation this work will present an approach that can be used to lsquo filter rsquo slices this approach basically introduces lsquo barriers rsquo which are not allowed to be passed during slice computation an earlier filtering approach is chopping which is also extended to obey such barrier the barrier variants of slicing and chopping provide filtering possibilities for smaller slices and better comprehensibility the concept of barriers is then applied to path conditions which provide necessary conditions under which an influence between the source and target criterion exists barriers make those conditions more precise

the task of linking databases is an important step in an increasing number of data mining projects because linked data can contain information that is not available otherwise or that would require time consuming and expensive collection of specific data the aim of linking is to match and aggregate all records that refer to the same entity one of the major challenges when linking large databases is the efficient and accurate classification of record pairs into matches and non matches while traditionally classification was based on manually set thresholds or on statistical procedures many of the more recently developed classification methods are based on supervised learning techniques they therefore require training data which is often not available in real world situations or has to be prepared manually an expensive cumbersome and time consuming process the author has previously presented novel two step approach to automatic record pair classification in the first step of this approach training examples of high quality are automatically selected from the compared record pairs and used in the second step to train support vector machine svm classifier initial experiments showed the feasibility of the approach achieving results that outperformed means clustering in this paper two variations of this approach are presented the first is based on nearest neighbour classifier while the second improves svm classifier by iteratively adding more examples into the training sets experimental results show that this two step approach can achieve better classification results than other unsupervised approaches

numerous qos routing strategies focus on end to end delays to provide time constrained routing protocols in wireless sensor networks wsns with the arrival of wireless multimedia sensor networks traffic can be composed of time sensitive packets and reliability demanding packets in such situations some works also take into account link reliability to provide probabilistic qos the trade off between the guarantee of the qos requirements and the network lifetime remains an open issue especially in large scale wsns this paper proposes promising multipath qos routing protocol based on separation of the nodes into two sub networks the first part includes specific nodes that are occasionally involved in routing decisions while the remaining nodes in the second sub network fully take part in them the qos routing is formulated as an optimization problem that aims to extend the network lifetime subject to qos constraints using the percolation theory routing algorithm is designed to solve the problem on the respective sub networks simulation results show the efficiency of this novel approach in terms of average end to end delays on time packet delivery ratio and network lifetime

release consistency is widely accepted memory model for distributed shared memory systems eager release consistency represents the state of the art in release consistent protocols for hardware coherent multiprocessors while lazy release consistency has been shown to provide better performance for software distributed shared memory dsm several of the optimizations performed by lazy protocols have the potential to improve the performance of hardware coherent multiprocessors as well but their complexity has precluded hardware implementation with the advent of programmable protocol processors it may become possible to use them after all we present and evaluate lazy release consistent protocol suitable for machines with dedicated protocol processors this protocol admits multiple concurrent writers sends write notices concurrently with computation and delays invalidations until acquire operations we also consider lazier protocol that delays sending write notices until release operations our results indicate that the first protocol outperforms eager release consistency by as much as across variety of applications the lazier protocol on the other hand is unable to recoup its high synchronization overhead this represents qualitative shift from the dsm world where lazier protocols always yield performance improvements based on our results we conclude that machines with flexible hardware support for coherence should use protocols based on lazy release consistency but in less aggressively lazy form than is appropriate for dsm

web applications routinely handle sensitive data and many people rely on them to support various daily activities so errors can have severe and broad reaching consequences unlike most desktop applications many web applications are written in scripting languages such as php the dynamic features commonly supported by these languages significantly inhibit static analysis and existing static analysis of these languages can fail to produce meaningful results on realworld web applications automated test input generation using the concolic testing framework has proven useful for finding bugs and improving test coverage on and java programs which generally emphasize numeric values and pointer based data structures however scripting languages such as php promote style of programming for developing web applications that emphasizes string values objects and arrays in this paper we propose an automated input test generation algorithm that uses runtime values to analyze dynamic code models the semantics of string operations and handles operations whose argument and return values may not share common type as in the standard concolic testing framework our algorithm gathers constraints during symbolic execution our algorithm resolves constraints over multiple types by considering each variable instance individually so that it only needs to invert each operation by recording constraints selectively our implementation successfully finds bugs in real world web applications which state of the art static analysis tools fail to analyze

whenever an array element is accessed java virtual machines execute compare instruction to ensure that the index value is within the valid bounds this reduces the execution speed of java programs array bounds check elimination identifies situations in which such checks are redundant and can be removed we present an array bounds check elimination algorithm for the java hotspot tm vm based on static analysis in the just in time compiler the algorithm works on an intermediate representation in static single assignment form and maintains conditions for index expressions it fully removes bounds checks if it can be proven that they never fail whenever possible it moves bounds checks out of loops the static number of checks remains the same but check inside loop is likely to be executed more often if such check fails the executing program falls back to interpreted mode avoiding the problem that an exception is thrown at the wrong place the evaluation shows speedup near to the theoretical maximum for the scientific scimark benchmark suite and also significant improvements for some java grande benchmarks the algorithm slightly increases the execution speed for the specjvm benchmark suite the evaluation of the dacapo benchmarks shows that array bounds checks do not have significant impact on the performance of object oriented applications

software reuse is regarded is as key software development objective leading to reduction of costs associated with software development and maintenance however there is mounting evidence that software reuse is difficult to achieve in practice and that software development approaches such as component based development and more recently service oriented computing have failed to achieve anticipated levels of reuse in this paper we identify the determinants of service reusability and argue that the design of services plays an important role in achieving high levels of reuse we examine the relationship between service granularity and reuse and note that extensive use of coarse grained document centric services by soa practitioners makes achieving reuse particularly challenging

we present novel approach to interdomain traffic engineering based on the concepts of nash bargaining and dual decomposition under this scheme isps use an iterative procedure to jointly optimize social cost function referred to as the nash product we show that the global optimization problem can be separated into subproblems by introducing appropriate shadow prices on the interdomain flows these subproblems can then be solved independently and in decentralized manner by the individual isps our approach does not require the isps to share any sensitive internal information such as network topology or link weights more importantly our approach is provably pareto efficient and fair therefore we believe that our approach is highly amenable to adoption by isps when compared to past approaches we also conduct simulation studies of our approach over several real isp topologies our evaluation shows that the approach converges quickly offers equitable performance improvements to isps is significantly better than unilateral approaches eg hot potato routing and offers the same performance as centralized solution with full knowledge
we propose deterministic fault tolerant and deadlock free routing protocol in two dimensional meshes based on dimension order routing and the odd even turn model the proposed protocol called extended routing does not use any virtual channels by prohibiting certain locations of faults and destinations faults are contained in set of disjointed rectangular regions called faulty blocks the number of faults to be tolerated is unbounded as long as nodes outside faulty blocks are connected in the mesh network the extended routing can also be used under special convex fault region called an orthogonal faulty block which can be derived from given faulty block by activating some nonfaulty nodes in the block extensions to partially adaptive routing traffic and adaptivity balanced using virtual networks and routing without constraints using virtual channels and virtual networks are also discussed
java application servers are gaining popularity as way for businesses to conduct day to day operations while strong emphasis has been placed on how to obtain peak performance only few research efforts have focused on these servers ability to sustain top performance in spite of the ever changing demands from users as preliminary study we conducted an experiment to observe the throughput degradation behavior of widely used java application server running standardized benchmark and found that throughput performance degrades ungracefully thus the goal of this work is three fold to identify the primary factors that cause poor throughput degradation ii to investigate how these factors affect throughput degradation and iii to observe how changes in algorithms and policies governing these factors affect throughput degradation

abstract we consider data clustering problems where partial grouping is known priori we formulate such biased grouping problems as constrained optimization problem where structural properties of the data define the goodness of grouping and partial grouping cues define the feasibility of grouping we enforce grouping smoothness and fairness on labeled data points so that sparse partial grouping information can be effectively propagated to the unlabeled data considering the normalized cuts criterion in particular our formulation leads to constrained eigenvalue problem by generalizing the rayleigh ritz theorem to projected matrices we find the global optimum in the relaxed continuous domain by eigendecomposition from which near global optimum to the discrete labeling problem can be obtained effectively we apply our method to real image segmentation problems where partial grouping priors can often be derived based on crude spatial attentional map that binds places with common salient features or focuses on expected object locations we demonstrate not only that it is possible to integrate both image structures and priors in single grouping process but also that objects can be segregated from the background without specific object knowledge
computing world distances of scene features from the captured images is common task in image analysis and scene understanding projective geometry based methods focus on measuring distance from one single image the scope of measurable scene is limited by the field of view fov of one single camera with full view panorama the scope of measurable scene is no longer limited by fov however the scope of measurable scene is limited by the fixed capture location of single panorama in this paper we propose one method of measuring distances of line segments in real world scene using panoramic video representation the scope of measurable scene is largely extended without the limitation of fov and fixed capture location prototype system called pv measure is developed to allow user to interactively measure the distances of line segments in panoramic video experiment results verify that the method offers good accuracy
cost based xml query optimization calls for accurate estimation of the selectivity of path expressions some other interactive and internet applications can also benefit from such estimations while there are number of estimation techniques proposed in the literature almost none of them has any guarantee on the estimation accuracy within given space limit in addition most of them assume that the xml data are more or less static ie with few updates in this paper we present framework for xml path selectivity estimation in dynamic context specifically we propose novel data structure bloom histogram to approximate xml path frequency distribution within small space budget and to estimate the path selectivity accurately with the bloom histogram we obtain the upper bound of its estimation error and discuss the trade offs between the accuracy and the space limit to support updates of bloom histograms efficiently when underlying xml data change dynamic summary layer is used to keep exact or more detailed xml path information we demonstrate through our extensive experiments that the new solution can achieve significantly higher accuracy with an even smaller space than the previous methods in both static and dynamic environments
we formulate new approach for evaluating prefetching algorithm we first carry out profiling run of program to identify all of the misses and corresponding locations in the program where prefetches for the misses can be initiated we then systematically control the number of misses that are prefetched the timeliness of these prefetches and the number of unused prefetches we validate the accuracy of our approach by comparing it to one based on markov prefetch algorithm this allows us to measure the potential benefit that any application can receive from prefetching and to analyze application behavior under conditions that cannot be explored with any known prefetching algorithm next we analyze system parameter that is vital to prefetching performance the line transfer interval which is the number of processor cycles required to transfer cache line this interval is determined by technology and bandwidth we show that under ideal conditions prefetching can remove nearly all of the stalls associated with cache misses unfortunately real processor implementations are less than ideal in particular the trend in processor frequency is outrunning on chip and off chip bandwidths today it is not uncommon for processor frequency to be three or four times bus frequency under these conditions we show that nearly all of the performance benefits derived from prefetching are eroded and in many cases prefetching actually degrades performance we carry out quantitative and qualitative analyses of these tradeoffs and show that there is linear relationship between overall performance and three metrics percentage of misses prefetched percentage of unused prefetches and bandwidth

in the recent past the recognition and localization of objects based on local point features has become widely accepted and utilized method among the most popular features are currently the sift features the more recent surf features and region based features such as the mser for time critical application of object recognition and localization systems operating on such features the sift features are too slow ms for images of size on ghz cpu the faster surf achieve computation time of ms which is still too slow for active tracking of objects or visual servoing applications in this paper we present combination of the harris corner detector and the sift descriptor which computes features with high repeatability and very good matching properties within approx ms while just computing the sift descriptors for computed harris interest points would lead to an approach that is not scale invariant we will show how scale invariance can be achieved without time consuming scale space analysis furthermore we will present results of successful application of the proposed features within our system for recognition and localization of textured objects an extensive experimental evaluation proves the practical applicability of our approach
this paper presents novel algorithm for computing graph edit distance ged in image categorization this algorithm is purely structural ie it needs only connectivity structure of the graph and does not draw on node or edge attributes there are two major contributions introducing edge direction histogram edh to characterize shape features of images it is shown that ged can be employed as distance of edhs this algorithm is completely independent on cost function which is difficult to be defined exactly computing distance of edhs with earth mover distance emd which takes neighborhood bins into account so as to compute distance of edhs correctly set of experiments demonstrate that the newly presented algorithm is available for classifying and clustering images and is immune to the planar rotation of images compared with ged from spectral seriation our algorithm can capture the structure change of graphs better and consume time used by the former one the average classification rate is and average clustering rate is higher than the spectral seriation method
type system with linearity is useful for checking software protocols andresource management at compile time linearity provides powerful reasoning about state changes but at the price of restrictions on aliasing the hard division between linear and nonlinear types forces the programmer to make trade off between checking protocol on an object and aliasing the object most onerous is the restriction that any type with linear component must itself be linear because of this checking protocol on an object imposes aliasing restrictions on any data structure that directly or indirectly points to the object we propose new type system that reduces these restrictions with the adoption and focus constructs adoption safely allows programmer to alias objects on which she is checking protocols and focus allows the reverse programmer can alias data structures that point to linear objects and use focus for safe access to those objects we discuss how we implemented these ideas in the vault programming language
in information retrieval cluster based retrieval is well known attempt in resolving the problem of term mismatch clustering requires similarity information between the documents which is difficult to calculate at feasible time the adaptive document clustering scheme has been investigated by researchers to resolve this problem however its theoretical viewpoint has not been fully discovered in this regard we provide conceptual viewpoint of the adaptive document clustering based on query based similarities by regarding the user's query as concept as result adaptive document clustering scheme can be viewed as an approximation of this similarity based on this idea we derive three new query based similarity measures in language modeling framework and evaluate them in the context of cluster based retrieval comparing with means clustering and full document expansion evaluation result shows that retrievals based on query based similarities significantly improve the baseline while being comparable to other methods this implies that the newly developed query based similarities become feasible criterions for adaptive document clustering
past studies have shown that objects are created and then die in phases thus one way to sustain good garbage collection efficiency is to have large enough heap to allow many allocation phases to complete and most of the objects to die before invoking garbage collection however such an operating environment is hard to maintain in large multithreaded applications because most typical time sharing schedulers are not allocation phase cognizant ie they often schedule threads in way that prevents them from completing their allocation phases quickly thus when garbage collection is invoked most allocation phases have yet to be completed resulting in poor collection efficiency we introduce two new scheduling strategies larf lower allocation rate first and mqrr memory quantum round robin designed to be allocation phase aware by assigning higher execution priority to threads in computation oriented phases the simulation results show thatallthe reductions of the garbage collection time in generational collector can range from when compare to round robin scheduler the reductions of the overall execution time and the average thread turnaround time range from and respectively
in this paper we propose an improved method of an efficient secure access control labeling under dynamic xml data streams environment the proposed method enables an efficient secure real time processing of query in mobile terminal and supports insertion of new nodes at arbitrary positions in the xml tree without re labeling and without conflicting although some researches have been done to maintain the document order in updating the main drawbacks in the most of these works are if the deletion and or insertion occur regularly then expensive re computing of affected labels is needed therefore we focus on how to design an efficient secure labeling scheme for xml trees which are frequently updated under dynamic xml data streams
fundamental to data cleaning is the need to account for multiple data representations we propose formal framework that can be used to reason about and manipulate data representations the framework is declarative and combines elements of generative grammar with database querying it also incorporates actions in the spirit of programming language compilers this framework has multiple applications such as parsing and data normalization data normalization is interesting in its own right in preparing data for analysis as well as in pre processing data for further cleansing we empirically study the utility of the framework over several real world data cleaning scenarios and find that with the right normalization often the need for further cleansing is minimized
customers purchase behavior may vary over time traditional collaborative filtering cf methods make recommendations to target customer based on the purchase behavior of customers whose preferences are similar to those of the target customer however the methods do not consider how the customers purchase behavior may vary over time in contrast the sequential rule based recommendation method analyzes customers purchase behavior over time to extract sequential rules in the form purchase behavior in previous periods purchase behavior in the current period if target customer's purchase behavior history is similar to the conditional part of the rule then his her purchase behavior in the current period is deemed to be the consequent part of the rule although the sequential rule method considers the sequence of customers purchase behavior over time it does not utilize the target customer's purchase data for the current period to resolve the above problems this work proposes novel hybrid recommendation method that combines the segmentation based sequential rule method with the segmentation based knn cf method the proposed method uses customers rfm recency frequency and monetary values to cluster customers into groups with similar rfm values for each group of customers sequential rules are extracted from the purchase sequences of that group to make recommendations meanwhile the segmentation based knn cf method provides recommendations based on the target customer's purchase data for the current period then the results of the two methods are combined to make final recommendations experiment results show that the hybrid method outperforms traditional cf methods

in several applications such as databases planning and sensor networks parameters such as selectivity load or sensed values are known only with some associated uncertainty the performance of such system as captured by some objective function over the parameters is significantly improved if some of these parameters can be probed or observed in resource constrained situation deciding which parameters to observe in order to optimize system performance itself becomes an interesting and important optimization problem this problem is the focus of this paper unfortunately designing optimal observation schemes is np hard even for the simplest objective functions leading to the study of approximation algorithms in this paper we present general techniques for designing non adaptive probing algorithms which are at most constant factor worse than optimal adaptive probing schemes interestingly this shows that for several problems of interest while probing yields significant improvement in the objective function being adaptive about the probing is not beneficial beyond constant factors
reps formerly called dsls are multiscale medial means for modeling and rendering solid geometry they are particularly well suited to model anatomic objects and in particular to capture prior geometric information effectively in deformable models segmentation approaches the representation is based on figural models which define objects at coarse scale by hierarchy of figures mdash each figure generally slab representing solid region and its boundary simultaneously this paper focuses on the use of single figure models to segment objects of relatively simple structurea single figure is sheet of medial atoms which is interpolated from the model formed by net ie mesh or chain of medial atoms hence the name reps each atom modeling solid region via not only position and width but also local figural frame giving figural directions and an object angle between opposing corresponding positions on the boundary implied by the rep the special capability of an rep is to provide spatial and orientational correspondence between an object in two different states of deformation this ability is central to effective measurement of both geometric typicality and geometry to image match the two terms of the objective function optimized in segmentation by deformable models the other ability of reps central to effective segmentation is their ability to support segmentation at multiple levels of scale with successively finer precision objects modeled by single figures are segmented first by similarity transform augmented by object elongation then by adjustment of each medial atom and finally by displacing dense sampling of the rep implied boundary while these models and approaches also exist in we focus on objectsthe segmentation of the kidney from ct and the hippocampus from mri serve as the major examples in this paper the accuracy of segmentation as compared to manual slice by slice segmentation is reported

munisocket multiple network interface socket provides mechanisms to enhance the communication performance properties such as throughput transfer time and reliability by utilizing the existing multiple network interface cards on communicating hosts although the munisocket model has some communication performance advantages over the regular socket it also has number of usability and manageability drawbacks including the complexity of establishing multiple channels and configuring them for good communication performance this paper discusses some enhancements for munisocket using autonomic computing techniques these techniques include self discovery for discovering the existence of network interfaces and their performance properties self configuration for establishing channels over the interfaces and self optimization for selecting the best channels combinations for efficiently sending messages of varying sizes while these techniques enhance the communication performance among computers they also reduce the complexity of configuring munisocket and make its interface compatible with the regular tcp socket interface which in turn allows for transparent use of munisocket by the applications
bounded semantics of ltl with existential interpretation and that of ectl the existential fragment of ctl and the characterization of these existentially interpreted properties have been studied and used as the theoretical basis for sat based bounded model checking this has led to lot of successful work with respect to error detection in the checking of ltl and actl the universal fragment of ctl properties by satisfiability testing bounded semantics of ltl with the universal interpretation and that of actl and the characterization of such properties by propositional formulas have not been successfully established and this hinders practical verification of valid universal properties by satisfiability checking this paper studies this problem and the contribution is bounded semantics for actl and characterization of actl properties by propositional formulas firstly we provide simple bounded semantics for actl without considering the practical aspect of the semantics based on converting kripke model to model called model in which the transition relation is captured by set of paths each path with transitions this bounded semantics is not practically useful for the evaluation of formula since it involves too many paths in the model then the technique is to divide the model into submodels with limited number of paths which depends on and the actl property to be verified such that if an actl property is true in every such model then it is true in the model as well this characterization can then be used as the basis for practical verification of valid actl properties by satisfiability checking simple case study is provided to show the use of this approach for both verification and error detection of an abstract two process program written as first order transition system

in this paper we propose means to enhance an architecture description language with description of component behavior notation used for this purpose should be able to express the interplay on the component's interfaces and reflect step by step refinement of the component's specification during its design in addition the notation should be easy to comprehend and allow for formal reasoning about the correctness of the specification refinement and also about the correctness of an implementation in terms of whether it adheres to the specification targeting all these requirements together the paper proposes employing behavior protocols which are based on notation similar to regular expressions as proof of the concept the behavior protocols are used in the sofa architecture description language at three levels interface frame and architecture key achievements of this paper include the definitions of bounded component behavior and protocol conformance relation using these concepts the designer can verify the adherence of component's implementation to its specification at runtime while the correctness of refining the specification can be verified at design time

to advance research and improve the scientific return on data collection and interpretation efforts in the geosciences we have developed methods of interactive visualization with special focus on immersive virtual reality vr environments earth sciences employ strongly visual approach to the measurement and analysis of geologic data due to the spatial and temporal scales over which such data ranges as observations and simulations increase in size and complexity the earth sciences are challenged to manage and interpret increasing amounts of data reaping the full intellectual benefits of immersive vr requires us to tailor exploratory approaches to scientific problems these applications build on the visualization method's strengths using both perception and interaction with data and models to take advantage of the skills and training of the geological scientists exploring their data in the vr environment this interactive approach has enabled us to develop suite of tools that are adaptable to range of problems in the geosciences and beyond
nested datatypes are families of datatypes that are indexed over all types such that the constructors may relate different family members moreover the argument types of the constructors refer to indices given by expressions where the family name may occur especially in this case of true nesting there is no direct support by theorem provers to guarantee termination of functions that traverse these data structuresa joint article with abel and uustalu tcs pp proposes iteration schemes that guarantee termination not by structural requirements but just by polymorphic typing they are generic in the sense that no specific syntactic form of the underlying datatype functor is required in subsequent work accepted for the journal of functional programming the author introduced an induction principle for the verification of programs obtained from mendler style iteration of rank which is one of those schemes and justified it in the calculus of inductive constructions through an implementation in the theorem prover coqthe new contribution is an extension of this work to generalized mendler iteration introduced in abel et al cited above leading to map fusion theorem for the obtained iterative functions the results and their implementation in coq are used for case study on representation of untyped lambda calculus with explicit flattening substitution is proven to fulfill two of the three monad laws the third only for hereditarily canonical terms but this is rectified by relativisation of the whole construction to those terms
we study the problem of tree pattern query rewriting using multiple views for the class of tree patterns in previous work has considered the rewriting problem using single view we consider two different ways of combining multiple views define rewritings of tree pattern using these combinations and study the relationship between them we show that when rewritings using single views do not exist we may use such combinations of multiple views to rewrite query and even if rewritings using single views do exist the rewritings using combinations of multiple views may provide more answers than those provided by the union of the rewritings using the individual views we also study properties of intersections of tree patterns and present algorithms for finding rewritings using intersections of views
the development of shape repositories and databases rises the need of online visualization of objects the main issue with the remote visualization of large meshes is the transfer latency of the geometric information the remote viewer requires the transfer of all polygons before allowing object's manipulation to avoid this latency problem an approach is to send several levels of details of the same object so that lighter versions can be displayed sooner and replaced with more detailed version later on this strategy requires more bandwidth implies abruptly changes in object aspect as the geometry refines as well as non negligible precomputing time since the appearance of model is more influenced by its normal field than its geometry we propose framework in which the object's lod is replaced with single simplified mesh with lod of appearance by using appearance preserving octree textures apo this appearance lod is encoded in unique texture and the details are progressively downloaded when they are needed our apo based framework achieves nearly immediate object rendering while details are transmitted and smoothly added to the texture scenes keep low geometry complexity while being displayed at interactive framerate with maximum of visual details leading to better visual quality over bandwith ratio than pure geometric lod schemes our implementation is platform independent as it uses jogl and runs on simple web browser furthermore the framework doesn't require processing on the server side during the client rendering
transactional memory tm is concurrent programming paradigm that aims to make concurrent programming easier than fine grain locking whilst providing similar performance and scalability several tm systems have been made available for research purposes however there is lack of wide range of non trivial benchmarks with which to thoroughly evaluate these tm systemsthis paper introduces lee tm non trivial and realistic tm benchmark suite based on lee's routing algorithm the benchmark suite provides sequential lock based and transactional implementations to enable direct performance comparison lee's routing algorithm has several of the desirable properties of non trivial tm benchmark such as large amounts of parallelism complex contention characteristics and wide range of transaction durations and lengths sample evaluation shows unfavourable transactional performance and scalability compared to lock based execution in contrast to much of the published tm evaluations and highlights the need for non trivial tm benchmarks
transactional memory offers significant advantages for concurrency control compared to locks this paper presents the design and implementation of transactional memory constructs in an unmanaged language unmanaged languages pose unique set of challenges to transactional memory constructs for example lack of type and memory safety use of function pointers aliasing of local variables and others this paper describes novel compiler and runtime mechanisms that address these challenges and optimize the performance of transactions in an unmanaged environment we have implemented these mechanisms in production quality compiler and high performance software transactional memory runtime we measure the effectiveness of these optimizations and compare the performance of lock based versus transaction based programming on set of concurrent data structures and the splash benchmark suite on processor smp system the transaction based version of the splash benchmarks scales much better than the coarse grain locking version and performs comparably to the fine grain locking version compiler optimizations significantly reduce the overheads of transactional memory so that on single thread the transaction based version incurs only about overhead compared to the lock based version for the splash benchmark suite thus our system is the first to demonstrate that transactions integrate well with an unmanaged language and can perform as well as fine grain locking while providing the programming ease of coarse grain locking even on an unmanaged environment
in single second modern processor can execute billions of instructions obtaining bird's eye view of the behavior of program at these speeds can be difficult task when all that is available is cycle by cycle examination in many programs behavior is anything but steady state and understanding the patterns of behavior at run time can unlock multitude of optimization opportunitiesin this paper we present unified profiling architecture that can efficiently capture classify and predict phase based program behavior on the largest of time scales by examining the proportion of instructions that were executed from different sections of code we can find generic phases that correspond to changes in behavior across many metrics by classifying phases generically we avoid the need to identify phases for each optimization and enable unified prediction scheme that can forecast future behavior our analysis shows that our design can capture phases that account for over of execution using less that bytes of on chip memory
every human being reading short report concerning road accident gets an idea of its causes the work reported here attempts to enable computer to do the same ie to determine the causes of an event from textual description of it it relies heavily on the notion of norm for two reasons the notion of cause has often been debated but remains poorly understood we postulate that what people tend to take as the cause of an abnormal event like an accident is the fact that specific norm has been violated natural language processing has given prominent place to deduction and for what concerns semantics to truth based inference however norm based inference is much more powerful technique to get the conclusions that human readers derive from text the paper describes complete chain of treatments from the text to the determination of the cause the focus is set on what is called linguistic and semantico pragmatic reasoning the former extracts so called semantic literals from the result of the parse and the latter reduces the description of the accident to small number of kernel literals which are sufficient to determine its cause both of them use non monotonic reasoning system viz lparse and smodels several issues concerning the representation of modalities and time are discussed and illustrated by examples taken from corpus of reports obtained from an insurance company
link analysis algorithms have been extensively used in web information retrieval however current link analysis algorithms generally work on flat link graph ignoring the hierarchal structure of the web graph they often suffer from two problems the sparsity of link graph and biased ranking of newly emerging pages in this paper we propose novel ranking algorithm called hierarchical rank as solution to these two problems which considers both the hierarchical structure and the link structure of the web in this algorithm web pages are first aggregated based on their hierarchical structure at directory host or domain level and link analysis is performed on the aggregated graph then the importance of each node on the aggregated graph is distributed to individual pages belong to the node based on the hierarchical structure this algorithm allows the importance of linked web pages to be distributed in the web page space even when the space is sparse and contains new pages experimental results on the gov collection of trec and show that hierarchical ranking algorithm consistently outperforms other well known ranking algorithms including the pagerank blockrank and layerrank in addition experimental results show that link aggregation at the host level is much better than link aggregation at either the domain or directory levels
dynamic tree data structures maintain forests that change over time through edge insertions and deletions besides maintaining connectivity information in logarithmic time they can support aggregation of information over paths trees or both we perform an experimental comparison of several versions of dynamic trees st trees et trees rc trees and two variants of top trees self adjusting and worst case we quantify their strengths and weaknesses through tests with various workloads most stemming from practical applications we observe that simple linear time implementation is remarkably fast for graphs of small diameter and that worst case and randomized data structures are best when queries are very frequent the best overall performance however is achieved by self adjusting st trees

in this paper we compare and contrast two techniques to improve capacity conflict miss traffic in cc numa dsm clusters page migration replication optimizes read write accesses to page used by single processor by migrating the page to that processor and replicates all read shared pages in the sharers local memories numa optimizes read write accesses to any page by allowing processor to cache that page in its main memory page migration replication requires less hardware complexity as compared to numa but has limited applicability and incurs much higher overheads even with tuned hardware software support in this paper we compare and contrast page migration replication and numa on simulated clusters of symmetric multiprocessors executing shared memory applications our results show that both page migration replication and numa significantly improve the system performance over ldquo first touch rdquo migration in many applications page migration replication has limited opportunity and can not eliminate all the capacity conflict misses even with fast hardware support and unlimited amount of memory numa always performs best given page cache large enough to fit an application's primary working set and subsumes page migration replication numa benefits more from hardware support to accelerate page operations than page migration replication and integrating page migration replication into numa to help reduce the hardware cost requires sophisticated mechanisms and policies to select candidates for page migration replication
the problem of implementing shared object of one type from shared objects of other types has been extensively researched recent focus has mostly been on wait free implementations which permit every process to complete its operations on implemented objects regardless of the speeds of other processes it is known that shared objects of different types have differing abilities to support wait free implementations it is therefore natural to want to arrange types in hierarchy that reflects their relative abilities to support wait free implementations in this paper we formally define robustness and other desirable properties of hierarchies roughly speaking hierarchy is robust if each type is ldquo stronger rdquo than any combination of lower level types we study two specific hierarchies one that we call hrm in which the level of type is based on the ability of an unbounded number of objects of that type and another hierarchy that we call hr in which type's level is based on the ability of fixed number of objects of that type we prove that resource bounded hierarchies such as hr and its variants are not robust we also establish the unique importance of hrm every nontrivial robust hierarchy if one exists is necessarily ldquo coarsening rdquo of hrm

the limited built in configurability of linux can lead to expensive code size overhead when it is used in the embedded market to overcome this problem we propose the application of link time compaction and specialization techniques that exploit the priori known fixed runtime environment of many embedded systems in experimental setups based on the arm xscale and platforms the proposed techniques are able to reduce the kernel memory footprint with over percnt we also show how relatively simple additions to existing binary rewriters can implement the proposed techniques for complex very unconventional program such as the linux kernel we note that even after specialization lot of seemingly unnecessary code remains in the kernel and propose to reduce the footprint of this code by applying code compression techniques this technique combined with the previous ones reduces the memory footprint with over percnt for the platform and percnt for the arm platform finally we pinpoint an important code size growth problem when compaction and compression techniques are combined on the arm platform
modern intrusion detection systems are comprised of three basically different approaches host based network based and third relatively recent addition called procedural based detection the first two have been extremely popular in the commercial market for number of years now because they are relatively simple to use understand and maintain however they fall prey to number of shortcomings such as scaling with increased traffic requirements use of complex and false positive prone signature databases and their inability to detect novel intrusive attempts this intrusion detection system interacts with the access control system to deny further access when detection occurs and represent practical implementation addressing these and other concerns this paper presents an overview of our work in creating practical database intrusion detection system based on many years of database security research the proposed solution detects wide range of specific and general forms of misuse provides detailed reports and has low false alarm rate traditional commercial implementations of database security mechanisms are very limited in defending successful data attacks authorized but malicious transactions can make database useless by impairing its integrity and availability the proposed solution offers the ability to detect misuse and subversion through the direct monitoring of database operations inside the database host providing an important complement to host based and network based surveillance suites of the proposed solution may be deployed throughout network and their alarms man aged correlated and acted on by remote or local subscribing security services thus helping to address issues of decentralized management

many database applications that need to disseminate dynamic information from server to various clients can suffer from heavy communication costs data caching at client can help mitigate these costs particularly when individual rm push hbox rm pull decisions are made for the different semantic regions in the data space the server is responsible for notifying the client about updates in the rm push regions the client needs to contact the server for queries that ask for data in the rm pull regions we call the idea of partitioning the data space into rm push hbox rm pull regions to minimize communication cost data gerrymandering in this paper we present solutions to technical challenges in adopting this simple but powerful idea we give provably optimal cost dynamic programming algorithm for gerrymandering on single query attribute we propose family of efficient heuristics for gerrymandering on multiple query attributes we handle the dynamic case in which the workloads of queries and updates evolve over time we validate our methods through extensive experiments on real and synthetic data sets
we introduce the bounded deformation tree or bd tree which can perform collision detection with reduced deformable models at costs comparable to collision detection with rigid objects reduced deformable models represent complex deformations as linear superpositions of arbitrary displacement fields and are used in variety of applications of interactive computer graphics the bd tree is bounding sphere hierarchy for output sensitive collision detection with such models its bounding spheres can be updated after deformation in any order and at cost independent of the geometric complexity of the model in fact the cost can be as low as one multiplication and addition per tested sphere and at most linear in the number of reduced deformation coordinates we show that the bd tree is also extremely simple to implement and performs well in practice for variety of real time and complex off line deformable simulation examples

we report on an automated runtime anomaly detection method at the application layer of multi node computer systems although several network management systems are available in the market none of them have sufficient capabilities to detect faults in multi tier web based systems with redundancy we model web based system as weighted graph where each node represents service and each edge represents dependency between services since the edge weights vary greatly over time the problem we address is that of anomaly detection from time sequence of graphsin our method we first extract feature vector from the adjacency matrix that represents the activities of all of the services the heart of our method is to use the principal eigenvector of the eigenclusters of the graph then we derive probability distribution for an anomaly measure defined for time series of directional data derived from the graph sequence given critical probability the threshold value is adaptively updated using novel online algorithmwe demonstrate that fault in web application can be automatically detected and the faulty services are identified without using detailed knowledge of the behavior of the system
experience sampling has been employed for decades to collect assessments of subjects intentions needs and affective states in recent years investigators have employed automated experience sampling to collect data to build predictive user models to date most procedures have relied on random sampling or simple heuristics we perform comparative analysis of several automated strategies for guiding experience sampling spanning spectrum of sophistication from random sampling procedure to increasingly sophisticated active learning the more sophisticated methods take decision theoretic approach centering on the computation of the expected value of information of probe weighing the cost of the short term disruptiveness of probes with their benefits in enhancing the long term performance of predictive models we test the different approaches in field study focused on the task of learning predictive models of the cost of interruption
most of the complexity of common data mining tasks is due to the unknown amount of information contained in the data being mined the more patterns and corelations are contained in such data the more resources are needed to extract them this is confirmed by the fact that in general there is not single best algorithm for given data mining task on any possible kind of input dataset rather in order to achieve good performances strategies and optimizations have to be adopted according to the dataset specific characteristics for example one typical distinction in transactional databases is between sparse and dense datasets in this paper we consider frequent set counting as case study for data mining algorithms we propose statistical analysis of the properties of transactional datasets that allows for characterization of the dataset complexity we show how such characterization can be used in many fields from performance prediction to optimization

chip multiprocessors cmps are promising candidates for the next generation computing platforms to utilize large numbers of gates and reduce the effects of high interconnect delays one of the key challenges in cmp design is to balance out the often conflicting demands specifically for today's image video applications and systems power consumption memory space occupancy area cost and reliability are as important as performance therefore compilation framework for cmps should consider multiple factors during the optimization process motivated by this observation this paper addresses the energy aware reliability support for the cmp architectures targeting in particular at array intensive image video applications there are two main goals behind our compiler approach first we want to minimize the energy wasted in executing replicas when there is no error during execution which should be the most frequent case in practice second we want to minimize the time to recover through the replicas from an error when it occurs this approach has been implemented and tested using four parallel array based applications from the image video processing domain our experimental evaluation indicates that the proposed approach saves significant energy over the case when all the replicas are run under the highest voltage frequency level without sacrificing any reliability over the latter

the question of determining which sets of constraints give rise to np complete problems and which give rise to tractable problems is an important open problem in the theory of constraint satisfaction it has been shown in previous papers that certain sufficient conditions for tractability and np completeness can be identified using algebraic properties of relations and that these conditions can be tested by solving particular form of constraint satisfaction problem the so called indicator problem this paper describes program which can solve the relevant indicator problems for arbitrary sets of constraints over small domains and for some sets of constraints over larger domains the main innovation in the program is its ability to deal with the many symmetries present in the problem it also has the ability to preserve symmetries in cases where this speeds up the solutionusing this program we have systematically investigated the complexity of all individual binary relations over domain of size four or less and of all individual ternary relations over domain of size three or less this automated analysis includes the derivation of more than new np completeness results and precisely identifies the small set of individual relations which cannot be classified as either tractable or np complete using the algebraic conditions presented in previous papers
the application of the tolerance paradigm to security intrusion tolerance has been raising reasonable amount of attention in the dependability and security communities in this paper we present novel approach to intrusion tolerence the idea is to use privileged components generically designated by wormholes to support the execution of intrusion tolerant protocols often called byzantine resilient in the literaturethe paper introduces the design of wormhole aware intrusion tolerant protocols using classical distributed systems problem consensus the system where the consensus protocol runs is mostly asynchronous and can fail in an arbitrary way except for the wormhole which is secure and synchronous using the wormhole to execute few critical steps the protocol manages to have low time complexity in the best case it runs in two rounds even if some processes are malicious the protocol also shows how often theoretical partial synchrony assumptions can be substantiated in practical distributed systems the paper shows the significance of the ttcb as an engineering paradigm since the protocol manages to be simple when compared with other protocols in the literature
this paper describes the design implementation and evaluation of areplication scheme to handle byzantine faults in transaction processing database systems the scheme compares answers from queries and updates on multiple replicas which are unmodified off the shelf systems to provide single database that is byzantine fault tolerant the scheme works when the replicas are homogeneous but it also allows heterogeneous replication in which replicas come from different vendors heterogeneous replicas reduce the impact of bugs and security compromises because they are implemented independently and are thus less likely to suffer correlated failures the main challenge in designing replication scheme for transactionprocessing systems is ensuring that the different replicas execute transactions in equivalent serial orders while allowing high degreeof concurrency our scheme meets this goal using novel concurrency control protocol commit barrier scheduling cbs we have implemented cbs in the context of replicated sql database hrdb heterogeneous replicated db which has been tested with unmodified production versions of several commercial and open source databases as replicas our experiments show an hrdb configuration that can tolerate one faulty replica has only modest performance overhead about for the tpc benchmark hrdb successfully masks several byzantine faults observed in practice and we have used it to find new bug in mysql

high performance computing applications with data driven communication and computation characteristics require synchronization routines in the form of eureka barrier or termination synchronization in this paper we consider termination synchronization for two different execution models the ap and the aps model in the ap model processors are either active or passive and passive processor can be made active by another active processor in the aps model processors can also be in server state passive processor entering the server state does not become active again in addition server processor cannot change the status of other processors we describe and analyze solutions for both models and present experimental work highlighting the differences between the models we show that in almost all situations the use of an ap algorithm to detect termination in an aps environment will result in loss of performance our experimental work on the cray te provides insight into where and why this performance loss occurs
wireless sensor networks are increasingly being used in applications where the communication between nodes needs to be protected from eavesdropping and tampering such protection is typically provided using techniques from symmetric key cryptography the protocols in this domain suffer from one or more of the following problems weak security guarantees if some nodes are compromised lack of scalability high energy overhead for key management and increased end to end data latency in this paper we propose protocol called secos that mitigates these problems in static sensor networks secos divides the sensor field into control groups each with control node data exchange between nodes within control group happens through the mediation of the control head which provides the common key the keys are refreshed periodically and the control nodes are changed periodically to enhance security secos enhances the survivability of the network by handling compromise and failures of control nodes it provides the guarantee that the communication between any two sensor nodes remains secure despite the compromise of any number of other nodes in the network the experiments based on simulation model show seven time reduction in energy overhead and reduction in latency compared to spins which is one of the state of the art protocols for key management in sensor networks

major challenge in frequent pattern mining is the sheer size of its mining results in many cases high minsup threshold may discover only commonsense patterns but low one may generate an explosive number of output patterns which severely restricts its usagein this paper we study the problem of compressing frequent pattern sets typically frequent patterns can be clustered with tightness measure delta called delta cluster and representative pattern can be selected for each cluster unfortunately finding minimum set of representative patterns is np hard we develop two greedy methods rpglobal and rplocal the former has the guaranteed compression bound but higher computational complexity the latter sacrifices the theoretical bounds but is far more efficient our performance study shows that the compression quality using rplocal is very close to rpglobal and both can reduce the number of closed frequent patterns by almost two orders of magnitude furthermore rplocal mines even faster than fpclose very fast closed frequent pattern mining method we also show that rpglobal and rplocal can be combined together to balance the quality and efficiency

the ability of reconfiguring software architectures in order to adapt them to new requirements or changing environment has been of growing interest but there is still not much formal work in the area most existing approaches deal with run time changes in deficient way the language to express computations is often at very low level of specification and the integration of two different formalisms for the computations and reconfigurations require sometimes substantial changes to address these problems we propose uniform algebraic approach with the following characteristicscomponents are written in high level program design language with the usual notion of statethe approach combines two existing frameworks mdash one to specify architectures the other to rewrite labelled graphs mdash just through small additions to either of themit deals with certain typical problems such as guaranteeing that new components are introduced in the correct state possibly transferred from the old components they replace it shows the relationships between reconfigurations and computations while keeping them separate because the approach provides semantics to given architecture through the algebraic construction of an equivalent program whose computations can be mirrored at the architectural level
deadlocks are possibly the best known bug pattern in computer systems in general certainly they are the best known in concurrent programming numerous articles some dating back more than years have been dedicated to the questions of how to design deadlock free programs how to statically or dynamically detect possible deadlocks how to avoid deadlocks at runtime and how to resolve deadlocks once they happen we start the paper with an investigation on how to exhibit potential deadlocks exhibiting deadlocks is very useful in testing as verifying if potential deadlock can actually happen is time consuming debugging activity there was recently some very interesting research in this direction however we believe our approach is more practical has no scaling issues and in fact is already industry readythe second contribution of our paper is in the area of healing multi threaded programs so they do not get into deadlocks this is an entirely new approach which is very different from the approaches in the literature that were meant for multi process scenarios and are not suitable and indeed not used in multithreaded programming while the basic ideas are fairly simple the details here are very important as any mistake is liable to actually create new deadlocks the paper describes the basic healing idea and its limitations the pitfalls and how to overcome them and experimental results
bursts in data center workloads are real problem for storage subsystems data volumes can experience peak request rates that are over an order of magnitude higher than average load this requires significant overprovisioning and often still results in significant request latency during peaks in order to address this problem we propose everest which allows data written to an overloaded volume to be temporarily off loaded into short term virtual store everest creates the short term store by opportunistically pooling underutilized storage resources either on server or across servers within the data center writes are temporarily off loaded from overloaded volumes to lightly loaded volumes thereby reducing the load on the former everest is transparent to and usable by unmodified applications and does not change the persistence or consistency of the storage system we evaluate everest using traces from production exchange mail server as well as other benchmarks our results show times reduction in mean response times during peaks
mutation testing measures the adequacy of test suite by seeding artificial defects mutations into program if mutation is not detected by the test suite this usually means that the test suite is not adequate however it may also be that the mutant keeps the program's semantics unchanged and thus cannot be detected by any test such equivalent mutants have to be eliminated manually which is tedious we assess the impact of mutations by checking dynamic invariants in an evaluation of our javalanche framework on seven industrial size programs we found that mutations that violate invariants are significantly more likely to be detectable by test suite as consequence mutations with impact on invariants should be focused upon when improving test suites with less than of equivalent mutants our approach provides an efficient precise and fully automatic measure of the adequacy of test suite

regression test suite prioritization techniques reorder test cases so that on average more faults will be revealed earlier in the test suite's execution than would otherwise be possible this paper presents genetic algorithm based test prioritization method that employs wide variety of mutation crossover selection and transformation operators to reorder test suite leveraging statistical analysis techniques such as tree model construction through binary recursive partitioning and kernel density estimation the paper's empirical results highlight the unique role that the selection operators play in identifying an effective ordering of test suite the study also reveals that while truncation selection consistently outperformed the tournament and roulette operators in terms of test suite effectiveness increasing selection pressure consistently produces the best results within each class of operator after further explicating the relationship between selection intensity termination condition fitness landscape and the quality of the resulting test suite this paper demonstrates that the genetic algorithm based prioritizer is superior to random search and hill climbing and thus suitable for many regression testing environments
information search and retrieval interactions usually involve information content in the form of document collections information retrieval systems and interfaces and the user to fully understand information search and retrieval interactions between users cognitive space and the information space researchers need to turn to cognitive models and theories in this article the authors use one of these theories the basic level theory use of the basic level theory to understand human categorization is both appropriate and essential to user centered design of taxonomies ontologies browsing interfaces and other indexing tools and systems analyses of data from two studies involving free sorting by participants of images were conducted the types of categories formed and category labels were examined results of the analyses indicate that image category labels generally belong to superordinate to the basic level and are generic and interpretive implications for research on theories of cognition and categorization and design of image indexing retrieval and browsing systems are discussed copy wiley periodicals inc
garbage collectors are notoriously hard to verify due to their low level interaction with the underlying system and the general difficulty in reasoning about reachability in graphs several papers have presented verified collectors but either the proofs were hand written or the collectors were too simplistic to use on practical applications in this work we present two mechanically verified garbage collectors both practical enough to use for real world benchmarks the collectors and their associated allocators consist of assembly language instructions and macro instructions annotated with preconditions postconditions invariants and assertions we used the boogie verification generator and the automated theorem prover to verify this assembly language code mechanically we provide measurements comparing the performance of the verified collector with that of the standard bartok collectors on off the shelf benchmarks demonstrating their competitiveness
reasoning about the termination of equational programs in sophisticated equational languages such as elan maude obj cafeobj haskell and so on requires support for advanced features such as evaluation strategies rewriting modulo use of extra variables in conditions partiality and expressive type systems possibly including polymorphism and higher order however many of those features are at best only partially supported by current term rewriting termination tools for instance mu term me aprove ttt termptation etc while they may be essential to ensure termination we present sequence of theory transformations that can be used to bridge the gap between expressive membership equational programs and such termination tools and prove the correctness of such transformations we also discuss prototype tool performing the transformations on maude equational programs and sending the resulting transformed theories to some of the aforementioned standard termination tools
as practical opportunity for educating japanese young developers in the field of embedded software development software design contest involving the design of software to automatically control line trace robot and conduct running performance tests was held in this paper we give the results of the contest from the viewpoint of software quality evaluation we create framework for evaluating the software quality which integrated design model quality and the final system performance and conduct analysis using the framework as result of analysis it is found that the quantitative measurement of the structural complexity of the design models bears strong relationship to qualitative evaluation of the design conducted by judges it is also found that there is no strong correlation between design model quality evaluated by the judges and the final system performance for embedded software development it is particularly important to estimate and verify reliability and performance in the early stages using the model based on the analysis result we consider possible remedies with respect to the models submitted the evaluation methods used and the contest specifications in order to adequately measure several non functional quality characteristics including performance on the model it is necessary to improve the way of developing robot software such as applying model driven development and reexamine the evaluation methods
semantic web data exhibits very skewed frequency distributions among terms efficient large scale distributed reasoning methods should maintain load balance in the face of such highly skewed distribution of input data we show that term based partitioning used by most distributed reasoning approaches has limited scalability due to load balancing problems we address this problem with method for data distribution based on clustering in elastic regions instead of as signing data to fixed peers data flows semi randomly in the network data items speed date while being temporarily collocated in the same peer we introduce bias in the routing to allow semantically clustered neighborhoods to emerge our approach is self organising efficient and does not require any central coordination we have implemented this method on the marvin platform and have performed experiments on large real world datasets using cluster of up to nodes we compute the rdfs closure over different datasets and show that our clustering algorithm drastically reduces computation time calculating the rdfs closure of million triples in minutes

successful application of data mining to bioinformatics is protein classification number of techniques have been developed to classify proteins according to important features in their sequences secondary structures or three dimensional structures in this paper we introduce novel approach to protein classification based on significant patterns discovered on the surface of protein we define notion called alpha hbox rm surface we discuss the geometric properties of alpha hbox rm surface and present an algorithm that calculates the alpha hbox rm surface from finite set of points in we apply the algorithm to extracting the alpha hbox rm surface of protein and use pattern discovery algorithm to discover frequently occurring patterns on the surfaces the pattern discovery algorithm utilizes new index structure called the delta rm tree we use these patterns to classify the proteins while most existing techniques focus on the binary classification problem we apply our approach to classifying three families of proteins experimental results show the good performance of the proposed approach
web pages like people are often known by others in variety of contexts when those contexts are sufficiently distinct page's importance may be better represented by multiple domains of authority rather than by one that indiscriminately mixes reputations in this work we determine domains of authority by examining the contexts in which page is cited however we find that it is not enough to determine separate domains of authority our model additionally determines the local flow of authority based upon the relative similarity of the source and target authority domains in this way we differentiate both incoming and outgoing hyperlinks by topicality and importance rather than treating them indiscriminately we find that this approach compares favorably to other topical ranking methods on two real world datasets and produces an approximately improvement in precision and quality of the top ten results over pagerank

in semi supervised learning number of labeled examples are usually required for training an initial weakly useful predictor which is in turn used for exploiting the unlabeled examples however in many real world applications there may exist very few labeled training examples which makes the weakly useful predictor difficult to generate and therefore these semisupervised learning methods cannot be applied this paper proposes method working under two view setting by taking advantages of the correlations between the views using canonical component analysis the proposed method can perform semi supervised learning with only one labeled training example experiments and an application to content based image retrieval validate the effectiveness of the proposed method
touch is compelling input modality for interactive devices however touch input on the small screen of mobile device is problematic because user's fingers occlude the graphical elements he wishes to work with in this paper we present lucidtouch mobile device that addresses this limitation by allowing the user to control the application by touching the back of the device the key to making this usable is what we call pseudo transparency by overlaying an image of the user's hands onto the screen we create the illusion of the mobile device itself being semi transparent this pseudo transparency allows users to accurately acquire targets while not occluding the screen with their fingers and hand lucid touch also supports multi touch input allowing users to operate the device simultaneously with all fingers we present initial study results that indicate that many users found touching on the back to be preferable to touching on the front due to reduced occlusion higher precision and the ability to make multi finger input
this paper evaluates five supervised learning methods in the context of statistical spam filtering we study the impact of different feature pruning methods and feature set sizes on each learner's performance using cost sensitive measures it is observed that the significance of feature selection varies greatly from classifier to classifier in particular we found support vector machine adaboost and maximum entropy model are top performers in this evaluation sharing similar characteristics not sensitive to feature selection strategy easily scalable to very high feature dimension and good performances across different datasets in contrast naive bayes commonly used classifier in spam filtering is found to be sensitive to feature selection methods on small feature set and fails to function well in scenarios where false positives are penalized heavily the experiments also suggest that aggressive feature pruning should be avoided when building filters to be used in applications where legitimate mails are assigned cost much higher than spams such as lambda so as to maintain better than baseline performance an interesting finding is the effect of mail headers on spam filtering which is often ignored in previous studies experiments show that classifiers using features from message header alone can achieve comparable or better performance than filters utilizing body features only this implies that message headers can be reliable and powerfully discriminative feature sources for spam filtering
scientific data are available through an increasing number of heterogeneous independently evolving sources although the sources themselves are independently evolving the data stored in them are not there exist inherent and intricate relationships between the distributed data sets and scientists are routinely required to write distributed queries in this setting being non experts in computer science the scientists are faced with two major challenges how to express such distributed queries this is non trivial task even if we assume that scientists are familiar with query languages like sql such queries can get arbitrarily complex as more sources are considered ii how to efficiently evaluate such distributed queries an efficient evaluation must account for batches of hundreds or even thousands of submitted queries and must optimize all of them as whole in this demo we focus on the biological domain for illustration purposes our solutions are applicable to other scientific domains and we present system called bioscout that offers solutions in both of the above challenges in more detail we demonstrate the following functionality in bioscout scientists draw their queries graphically resulting in query graph the scientist is unaware of the query language used or of any optimization issues given the query graph the system is able to generate as first step an optimal query plan for the submitted query ii bioscout uses four different strategies to combine the optimal query plans of individual queries to generate global query plan for all the submitted queries in the demo we illustrate graphically how each of the four strategies works
reusing software artifacts for system development is showing increasing promise as an approach to reducing the time and effort involved in building new systems and to improving the software development process and the quality of its outcome however software reuse has an associated steep learning curve since practitioners must become familiar with third party rationale for representing and implementing reusable assets for this reason enabling systematic approach to the reuse process by making software reuse tasks explicit allowing software frameworks to be instantiated using pre defined primitive and complex reuse operations and supporting the reuse process in semi automated way become crucial goals in this paper we present systematic reuse approach and the reuse description language rdl language designed to specify object oriented framework instantiation processes and an rdl execution environment which is the tool support for definition and execution of reuse processes and framework instantiations that lead to domain specific applications we illustrate our approach using dtframe framework for creating drawing editors
offering online personalized recommendation services helps improve customer satisfaction conventionally recommendation system is considered as success if clients purchase the recommended products however the act of purchasing itself does not guarantee satisfaction and truly successful recommendation system should be one that maximizes the customer's after use gratification by employing an innovative associative classification method we are able to predict customer's ultimate pleasure based on customer's characteristics product will be recommended to the potential buyer if our model predicts his her satisfaction level will be high the feasibility of the proposed recommendation system is validated through laptop inspiron
this paper draws several observations from our experiences in building support for object groups these observations actually go beyond our experiences and may apply to many other developments of object based distributed systemsour first experience aimed at building support for smalltalk object replication using the isis process group toolkit it was quite easy to achieve group transparency but we were confronted with strong mismatch between the rigidity of the process group model and the flexible nature of object interactions consequently we decided to build our own object oriented protocol framework specifically dedicated to support object groups instead of using process group toolkit we built our framework in such way that basic distributed protocols such as failure detection and multicasts are considered as first class entities directly accessible to the programmers to achieve flexible and dynamic protocol composition we had to go beyond inheritance and objectify distributed algorithmsour second experience consisted in building corba service aimed at managing group of objects written on different languages and running on different platforms this experience revealed mismatch between the asynchrony of group protocols and the synchrony of standard corba interaction mechanisms which limited the portability of our corba object group service we restricted the impact of this mismatch by encapsulating asynchrony issues inside specific messaging sub servicewe dissect the cost of object group transparency in our various implementations and we point out the recurrent sources of overheads namely message indirection marshaling unmarshaling and strong consistency
several parallel architectures such as gpus and the cell processor have fast explicitly managed on chip memories in addition to slow off chip memory they also have very high computational power with multiple levels of parallelism significant challenge in programming these architectures is to effectively exploit the parallelism available in the architecture and manage the fast memories to maximize performance in this paper we develop an approach to effective automatic data management for on chip memories including creation of buffers in on chip local memories for holding portions of data accessed in computational block automatic determination of array access functions of local buffer references and generation of code that moves data between slow off chip memory and fast local memories we also address the problem of mapping computation in regular programs to multi level parallel architectures using multi level tiling approach and study the impact of on chip memory availability on the selection of tile sizes at various levels experimental results on gpu demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
adaptation online learning by autonomous virtual characters due to interaction with human user in virtual environment is difficult and important problem in computer animation in this article we present novel multi level technique for fast character adaptation we specifically target environments where there is cooperative or competitive relationship between the character and the human that interacts with that characterin our technique distinct learning method is applied to each layer of the character's behavioral or cognitive model this allows us to efficiently leverage the character's observations and experiences in each layer this also provides convenient temporal distinction between what observations and experiences provide pertinent lessons for each layer thus the character can quickly and robustly learn how to better interact with any given unique human user relying only on observations and natural performance feedback from the environment no explicit feedback from the human our technique is designed to be general and can be easily integrated into most existing behavioral animation systems it is also fast and memory efficient
we compress storage and accelerate performance of precomputed radiance transfer prt which captures the way an object shadows scatters and reflects light prt records over many surface points transfer matrix at run time this matrix transforms vector of spherical harmonic coefficients representing distant low frequency source lighting into exiting radiance per point transfer matrices form high dimensional surface signal that we compress using clustered principal component analysis cpca which partitions many samples into fewer clusters each approximating the signal as an affine subspace cpca thus reduces the high dimensional transfer signal to low dimensional set of per point weights on per cluster set of representative matrices rather than computing weighted sum of representatives and applying this result to the lighting we apply the representatives to the lighting per cluster on the cpu and weight these results per point on the gpu since the output of the matrix is lower dimensional than the matrix itself this reduces computation we also increase the accuracy of encoded radiance functions with new least squares optimal projection of spherical harmonics onto the hemisphere we describe an implementation on graphics hardware that performs real time rendering of glossy objects with dynamic self shadowing and interreflection without fixing the view or light as in previous work our approach also allows significantly increased lighting frequency when rendering diffuse objects and includes subsurface scattering
structured documents are commonly edited using free form editor even though every string is an acceptable input it makes sense to maintain structured representation of the edited document the structured representation has number of uses structural navigation and optional structural editing structure highlighting etc the construction of the structure must be done incrementally to be efficient the time to process an edit operation should be proportional to the size of the change and ideally independent of the total size of the document we show that combining lazy evaluation and caching of intermediate partial results enables incremental parsing we build complete incremental parsing library for interactive systems with support for error correction
we present novel semi supervised boosting algorithms that incrementally build linear combinations of weak classifiers through generic functional gradient descent using both labeled and unlabeled training data our approach is based on extending information regularization framework to boosting bearing loss functions that combine log loss on labeled data with the information theoretic measures to encode unlabeled data even though the information theoretic regularization terms make the optimization non convex we propose simple sequential gradient descent optimization algorithms and obtain impressively improved results on synthetic benchmark and real world tasks over supervised boosting algorithms which use the labeled data alone and state of the art semi supervised boosting algorithm
fast and efficient page ranking mechanism for web crawling and retrieval remains as challenging issue recently several link based ranking algorithms like pagerank hits and opic have been proposed in this paper we propose novel recursive method based on reinforcement learning which considers distance between pages as punishment called distancerank to compute ranks of web pages the distance is defined as the number of average clicks between two pages the objective is to minimize punishment or distance so that page with less distance to have higher rank experimental results indicate that distancerank outperforms other ranking algorithms in page ranking and crawling scheduling furthermore the complexity of distancerank is low we have used university of california at berkeley's web for our experiments

radio frequency identification rfid technologies are used in many applications for data collection however raw rfid readings are usually of low quality and may contain many anomalies an ideal solution for rfid data cleansing should address the following issues first in many applications duplicate readings by multiple readers simultaneously or by single reader over period of time of the same object are very common the solution should take advantage of the resulting data redundancy for data cleaning second prior knowledge about the readers and the environment eg prior data distribution false negative rates of readers may help improve data quality and remove data anomalies and desired solution must be able to quantify the degree of uncertainty based on such knowledge third the solution should take advantage of given constraints in target applications eg the number of objects in same location cannot exceed given value to elevate the accuracy of data cleansing there are number of existing rfid data cleansing techniques however none of them support all the aforementioned features in this paper we propose bayesian inference based approach for cleaning rfid raw data our approach takes full advantage of data redundancy to capture the likelihood we design an state detection model and formally prove that the state model can maximize the system performance moreover in order to sample from the posterior we devise metropolis hastings sampler with constraints mh which incorporates constraint management to clean rfid raw data with high efficiency and accuracy we validate our solution with common rfid application and demonstrate the advantages of our approach through extensive simulations
searchable symmetric encryption sse allows party to outsource the storage of its data to another party server in private manner while maintaining the ability to selectively search over it this problem has been the focus of active research in recent years in this paper we show two solutions to sse that simultaneously enjoy the following properties both solutions are more efficient than all previous constant round schemes in particular the work performed by the server per returned document is constant as opposed to linear in the size of the data both solutions enjoy stronger security guarantees than previous constant round schemes in fact we point out subtle but serious problems with previous notions of security for sse and show how to design constructions which avoid these pitfalls further our second solution also achieves what we call adaptive sse security where queries to the server can be chosen adaptively by the adversary during the execution of the search this notion is both important in practice and has not been previously consideredsurprisingly despite being more secure and more efficient our sse schemes are remarkably simple we consider the simplicity of both solutions as an important step towards the deployment of sse technologiesas an additional contribution we also consider multi user sse all prior work on sse studied the setting where only the owner of the data is capable of submitting search queries we consider the natural extension where an arbitrary group of parties other than the owner can submit search queries we formally define sse in the multi user setting and present an efficient construction that achieves better performance than simply using access control mechanisms
in this work we analyze the behavior on company internal social network site to determine which interaction patterns signal closeness between colleagues regression analysis suggests that employee behavior on social network sites snss reveals information about both professional and personal closeness while some factors are predictive of general closeness eg content recommendations other factors signal that employees feel personal closeness towards their colleagues but not professional closeness eg mutual profile commenting this analysis contributes to our understanding of how sns behavior reflects relationship multiplexity the multiple facets of our relationships with sns connections
in this paper we present new approach that incorporates semantic structure of sentences in form of verb argument structure to measure semantic similarity between sentences the variability of natural language expression makes it difficult for existing text similarity measures to accurately identify semantically similar sentences since sentences conveying the same fact or concept may be composed lexically and syntactically different inversely sentences which are lexically common may not necessarily convey the same meaning this poses significant impact on many text mining applications performance where sentence level judgment is involved the evaluation has shown that by processing sentence at its semantic level the performance of similarity measures is significantly improved
the aim in this paper is to develop method for clustering together image views of the same object class local invariant feature methods such as sift have been proven effective for image clustering however they have made either relatively little use or too complex use of geometric constraints and are confounded when the detected features are superabundant here we make two contributions aimed at overcoming these problems first we rank the sift points sift using visual saliency second we use the reduced set of sift features to construct specific hyper graph cshg model of holistic structure based on the cshg model two stage clustering method is proposed in which images are clustered according to the pairwise similarity of the graphs which is combination of the traditional similarity of local invariant feature vectors and the geometric similarity between two graphs this method comprehensively utilizes both sift and geometric constraints and hence combines both global and local information experiments reveal that the method gives excellent clustering performance

the file system api of contemporary systems makes programs vulnerable to tocttou time of check to time of use race conditions existing solutions either help users to detect these problems by pinpointing their locations in the code or prevent the problem altogether by modifying the kernel or its api the latter alternative is not prevalent and the former is just the first step programmers must still address tocttou flaws within the limits of the existing api with which several important tasks can not be accomplished in portable straightforward manner recently dean and hu addressed this problem and suggested probabilistic hardness amplification approach that alleviated the matter alas shortly after borisov et al responded with an attack termed filesystem maze that defeated the new approach we begin by noting that mazes constitute generic way to deterministically win many tocttou races gone are the days when the probability was small in the face of this threat we develop new user level defense that can withstand mazes and show that our method is undefeated even by much stronger hypothetical attacks that provide the adversary program with ideal conditions to win the race enjoying complete and instantaneo us knowledge about the defending program's actions and being able to perfectly synchronize accordingly the fact that our approach is immune to these unrealistic attacks suggests it can be used as simple and portable solution to large class of tocttou vulnerabilities without requiring modifications to the underlying operating system

coordinations in noun phrases often pose the problem that elliptified parts have to be reconstructed for proper semantic interpretation unfortunately the detection of coordinated heads and identification of elliptified elements notoriously lead to ambiguous reconstruction alternatives while linguistic intuition suggests that semantic criteria might play an important if not superior role in disambiguating resolution alternatives our experiments on the reannotated wsj part of the penn treebank indicate that solely morpho syntactic criteria are more predictive than solely lexico semantic ones we also found that the combination of both criteria does not yield any substantial improvement
this paper describes an approach to modeling the evolution of non secure applications into secure applications in terms of the software requirements model and software architecture model the requirements for security services are captured separately from application requirements and the security services are encapsulated in connectors in the software architecture separately from the components providing functional services the enterprise architecture is described in terms of use case models static models and dynamic models the software architecture is described in terms of components and connectors which can be deployed to distributed configurations by separating application concerns from security concerns the evolution from non secure application to secure application can be achieved with less impact on the application an electronic commerce system is described to illustrate the approach

information systems support data privacy by constraining user's access to public views and thereby hiding the non public underlying data the privacy problem is to prove that none of the private data can be inferred from the information which is made public we present formal definition of the privacy problem which is based on the notion of certain answer then we investigate the privacy problem in the contexts of relational databases and ontology based information systems
object petri nets opns provide natural and modular method for modelling many real world systems we give structure pre serving translation of opns to prolog by encoding the opn semantics avoiding the need for an unfolding to flat petri net the translation provides support for reference and value semantics and even allows different objects to be treated as copyable or non copyable the method is developed for opns with arbitrary nesting we then apply logic programming tools to animate compile and model check opns in particular we use the partial evaluation system logen to produce an opn compiler and we use the model checker xtl to verify ctl formulae we also use logen to produce special purpose model checkers we present two case studies along with experimental results comparison of opn translations to maude specifications and model checking is given showing that our approach is roughly twice as fast for larger systems we also tackle infinite state model checking using the ecce system
part decomposition and conversely the construction of composite objects out of individual parts have long been recognized as ubiquitous and essential mechanisms involving abstraction this applies in particular in areas such as cad manufacturing software development and computer graphics although the part of relationship is distinguished in object oriented modeling techniques it ranks far behind the concept of generalization specialization and rigorous definition of its semantics is still missing in this paper we first show in which ways shift in emphasis on the part of relationship leads to analysis and design models that are easier to understand and to maintain we then investigate the properties of part of relationships in order to define their semantics this is achieved by means of categorization of part of relationships and by associating semantic constraints with individual categories we further suggest precise and compared with existing techniques less redundant specification of constraints accompanying part of categories based on the degree of exclusiveness and dependence of parts on composite objects although the approach appears generally applicable the object oriented unified modeling language uml is used to present our findings several examples demonstrate the applicability of the categories introduced
distributed denial of service ddos is major threat to the availability of internet services the anonymity allowed by ip networking together with the distributed large scale nature of the internet makes ddos attacks stealthy and difficult to counter to make the problem worse attack traffic is often indistinguishable from normal traffic as various attack tools become widely available and require minimum knowledge to operate automated anti ddos systems become increasingly important many current solutions are either excessively expensive or require universal deployment across many administrative domains this paper proposes two perimeter based defense mechanisms for internet service providers isps to provide the anti ddos service to their customers these mechanisms rely completely on the edge routers to cooperatively identify the flooding sources and establish rate limit filters to block the attack traffic the system does not require any support from routers outside or inside of the isp which not only makes it locally deployable but also avoids the stress on the isp core routers we also study new problem of perimeter based ip traceback and provide three solutions we demonstrate analytically and by simulations that the proposed defense mechanisms react quickly in blocking attack traffic while achieving high survival ratio for legitimate traffic even when percent of all customer networks attack the survival ratio for traffic from the other customer networks is still close to percent
query suggestion aims to suggest relevant queries for given query which help users better specify their information needs previously the suggested terms are mostly in the same language of the input query in this paper we extend it to cross lingual query suggestion clqs for query in one language we suggest similar or relevant queries in other languages this is very important to scenarios of cross language information retrieval clir and cross lingual keyword bidding for search engine advertisement instead of relying on existing query translation technologies for clqs we present an effective means to map the input query of one language to queries of the other language in the query log important monolingual and cross lingual information such as word translation relations and word co occurrence statistics etc are used to estimate the cross lingual query similarity with discriminative model benchmarks show that the resulting clqs system significantly out performs baseline system based on dictionary based query translation besides the resulting clqs is tested with french to english clir tasks on trec collections the results demonstrate higher effectiveness than the traditional query translation methods
data mining research typically assumes that the data to be analyzed has been identified gathered cleaned and processed into convenient form while data mining tools greatly enhance the ability of the analyst to make data driven discoveries most of the time spent in performing an analysis is spent in data identification gathering cleaning and processing the data similarly schema mapping tools have been developed to help automate the task of using legacy or federated data sources for new purpose but assume that the structure of the data sources is well understood however the data sets to be federated may come from dozens of databases containing thousands of tables and tens of thousands of fields with little reliable documentation about primary keys or foreign keyswe are developing system bellman which performs data mining on the structure of the database in this paper we present techniques for quickly identifying which fields have similar values identifying join paths estimating join directions and sizes and identifying structures in the database the results of the database structure mining allow the analyst to make sense of the database content this information can be used to eg prepare data for data mining find foreign key joins for schema mapping or identify steps to be taken to prevent the database from collapsing under the weight of its complexity
bansal and sviridenko bansal sviridenko new approximability and inapproximability results for dimensional bin packing in proceedings of the th annual acm siam symposium on discrete algorithms soda pp proved that there is no asymptotic ptas for dimensional orthogonal bin packing without rotations unless np we show that similar approximation hardness results hold for several and dimensional rectangle packing and covering problems even if rotations by ninety degrees are allowed moreover for some of these problems we provide explicit lower bounds on asymptotic approximation ratio of any polynomial time approximation algorithm our hardness results apply to the most studied case of dimensional problems with unit square bins and for dimensional strip packing and covering problems with strip of unit square base
an understanding of the topological structure of the internet is needed for quite number of networking tasks making decisions about peering relationships choice of upstream providers inter domain traffic engineering one essential component of these tasks is the ability to predict routes in the internet however the internet is composed of large number of independent autonomous systems ases resulting in complex interactions and until now no model of the internet has succeeded in producing predictions of acceptable accuracywe demonstrate that there are two limitations of prior models they have all assumed that an autonomous system as is an atomic structure it is not and ii models have tended to oversimplify the relationships between ases our approach uses multiple quasi routers to capture route diversity within the ases and is deliberately agnostic regarding the types of relationships between ases the resulting model ensures that its routing is consistent with the observed routes exploiting large number of observation points we show that our model provides accurate predictions for unobserved routes first step towards developing structural mod els of the internet that enable real applications
in standard text retrieval systems the documents are gathered and indexed on single server in distributed information retrieval dir the documents are held in multiple collections answers to queries are produced by selecting the collections to query and then merging results from these collections however in most prior research in the area collections are assumed to be disjoint in this paper we investigate the effectiveness of different combinations of server selection and result merging algorithms in the presence of duplicates we also test our hash based method for efficiently detecting duplicates and near duplicates in the lists of documents returned by collections our results based on two different designs of test data indicate that some dir methods are more likely to return duplicate documents and show that removing such redundant documents can have significant impact on the final search effectiveness
distributed hash tables dhts excel at exact match lookups but they do not directly support complex queries such as semantic search that is based on content in this paper we propose novel approach to efficient semantic search on dht overlays the basic idea is to place indexes of semantically close files into same peer nodes with high probability by exploiting information retrieval algorithms and locality sensitive hashing query for retrieving semantically close files is answered with high recall by consulting only small number eg of nodes that stores the indexes of the files semantically close to the query our approach adds only index information to peer nodes imposing only small storage overhead via detailed simulations we show that our approach achieves high recall for queries at very low cost ie the number of nodes visited for query is about independent of the overlay size
we propose notion of deterministic association rules for ordered data we prove that our proposed rules can be formally justified by purely logical characterization namely natural notion of empirical horn approximation for ordered data which involves background horn conditions these ensure the consistency of the propositional theory obtained with the ordered context the whole framework resorts to concept lattice models from formal concept analysis but adapted to ordered contexts we also discuss general method to mine these rules that can be easily incorporated into any algorithm for mining closed sequences of which there are already some in the literature
this paper presents novel architectural technique to hide fetch latency overhead of hardware encrypted and authenticated memory number of recent secure processor designs have used memory block encryption and authentication to protect un trusted external memory however the latency overhead of certain encryption modes or authentication schemes can be intolerably high this paper proposes novel techniques called frequent value ciphertext speculation and frequent value mac speculation that synergistically combine value prediction and the inherently pipelined cryptography hardware to address the issue of latency for memory decryption and authentication without sacrificing security frequent value ciphertext speculation can speed up memory decryption or mac integrity verification by speculatively encrypting predictable memory values and comparing the result ciphertext with the fetched ciphertext in mac speculation secure processor pre computes mac for speculated frequent values and compares the mac result with the fetched mac from memory using spec benchmark suite and detailed architecture simulator our results show that ciphertext speculation and mac speculation can significantly improve performance for direct memory encryption modes based on only most frequent bit values for eight benchmark programs the speedup is over and some benchmark programs achieve more than speedup for counter mode encrypted memory mac speculation can also significantly reduce the authentication overhead
an abstract type groups variables that are used for related purposes in program we describe dynamic unification based analysis for inferring abstract types initially each run time value gets unique abstract type run time interaction among values indicates that they have the same abstract type so their abstract types are unified also at run time abstract types for variables are accumulated from abstract types for values the notion of interaction may be customized permitting the analysis to compute finer or coarser abstract types these different notions of abstract type are useful for different tasks we have implemented the analysis for compiled binaries and for java bytecodes our experiments indicate that the inferred abstract types are useful for program comprehension improve both the results and the run time of follow on program analysis and are more precise than the output of comparable static analysis without suffering from overfitting

in multi hop wireless networks the mobile nodes usually act as routers to relay packets generated from other nodes however selfish nodes do not cooperate but make use of the honest ones to relay their packets which has negative effect on fairness security and performance of the network in this paper we propose novel incentive mechanism to stimulate cooperation in multi hop wireless networks fairness can be achieved by using credits to reward the cooperative nodes the overhead can be significantly reduced by using cheating detection system cds to secure the payment extensive security analysis demonstrates that the cds can identify the cheating nodes effectively under different cheating strategies simulation results show that the overhead of the proposed incentive mechanism is incomparable with the existing ones
finite automaton simply referred to as robot has to explore graph whose nodes are unlabeled and whose edge ports are locally labeled at each node the robot has no priori knowledge of the topology of the graph or of its size its task is to traverse all the edges of the graph we first show that for any state robot and any there exists planar graph of maximum degree with at most nodes that the robot cannot explore this bound improves all previous bounds in the literature more interestingly we show that in order to explore all graphs of diameter and maximum degree robot needs log memory bits even if we restrict the exploration to planar graphs this latter bound is tight indeed simple dfs up to depth enables robot to explore any graph of diameter and maximum degree using memory of size log bits we thus prove that the worst case space complexity of graph exploration is log bits
access control models are usually static ie permissions are granted based on policy that only changes seldom especially for scenarios in health care and disaster management more flexible support of access control ie the underlying policy is needed break glass is one approach for such flexible support of policies which helps to prevent system stagnation that could harm lives or otherwise result in losses today break glass techniques are usually added on top of standard access control solutions in an ad hoc manner and therefore lack an integration into the underlying access control paradigm and the systems access control enforcement architecture we present an approach for integrating in fine grained manner break glass strategies into standard access control models and their accompanying enforcement architecture this integration provides means for specifying break glass policies precisely and supporting model driven development techniques based on such policies
we present new linear time algorithm to compute good order for the point set of delaunay triangulation in the plane such good order makes reconstruction in linear time with simple algorithm possible similarly to the algorithm of snoeyink and van kreveld proceedings of th european symposium on algorithms esa pp our algorithm constructs such orders in logn phases by repeatedly removing constant fraction of vertices from the current triangulation compared to proceedings of th european symposium on algorithms esa pp we improve the guarantee on the number of removed vertices in each such phase if we restrict the degree of the points at the time they are removed to our algorithm removes at least of the points while the algorithm from proceedings of th european symposium on algorithms esa pp gives guarantee of we achieve this improvement by removing the points sequentially using breadth first search bfs based procedure that in contrast to proceedings of th european symposium on algorithms esa pp does not necessarily remove an independent set besides speeding up the algorithm removing more points in single phase has the advantage that two consecutive points in the computed order are usually closer to each other for this reason we believe that our approach is better suited for vertex coordinate compression we implemented prototypes of both algorithms and compared their running time on point sets uniformly distributed in the unit cube our algorithm is slightly faster to compare the vertex coordinate compression capabilities of both algorithms we round the resulting sequences of vertex coordinates to bit integers and compress them with simple variable length code our algorithm achieves about better vertex data compression than the algorithm from proceedings of th european symposium on algorithms esa pp
we investigate proof rules for information hiding using the recent formalism of separation logic in essence we use the separating conjunction to partition the internal resources of module from those accessed by the module's clients the use of logical connective gives rise to form of dynamic partitioning where we track the transfer of ownership of portions of heap storage between program components it also enables us to enforce separation in the presence of mutable data structures with embedded addresses that may be aliased

in any collaborative system there are both symmetries and asymmetries present in the design of the technology and in the ways that technology is appropriated yet media space research tends to focus more on supporting and fostering the symmetries than the asymmetries throughout more than years of media space research the pursuit of increased symmetry whether achieved through technical or social means has been recurrent theme the research literature on the use of contemporary awareness systems in contrast displays little if any of this emphasis on symmetrical use indeed this body of research occasionally highlights the perceived value of asymmetry in this paper we unpack the different forms of asymmetry present in both media spaces and contemporary awareness systems we argue that just as asymmetry has been demonstrated to have value in contemporary awareness systems so might asymmetry have value in media spaces and in other cscw systems more generally to illustrate we present media space that emphasizes and embodies multiple forms of asymmetry and does so in response to the needs of particular work context
compilers for polymorphic languages can use runtime type inspection to support advanced implementation techniques such as tagless garbage collection polymorphic marshalling and flattened data structures intensional type analysis is type theoretic framework for expressing and certifying such type analyzing computations unfortunately existing approaches to intensional analysis do not work well on types with universal existential or fixpoint quantifiers this makes it impossible to code applications such as garbage collection persistence or marshalling which must be able to examine the type of any runtime valuewe present typed intermediate language that supports fully reflexive intensional type analysis by fully reflexive we mean that type analyzing operations are applicable to the type of any runtime value in the language in particular we provide both type level and term level constructs for analyzing quantified types our system supports structural induction on quantified types yet type checking remains decidable we show how to use reflexive type analysis to support type safe marshalling and how to generate certified type analyzing object code
efficient subsumption checking deciding whether subscription or publication is covered by set of previously defined subscriptions is of paramount importance for publish subscribe systems it provides the core system functionality matching of publications to subscriber needs expressed as subscriptions and additionally reduces the overall system load and generated traffic since the covered subscriptions are not propagated in distributed environments as the subsumption problem was shown previously to be co np complete and existing solutions typically apply pairwise comparisons to detect the subsumption relationship we propose monte carlo type probabilistic algorithm for the general subsumption problem it determines whether publication subscription is covered by disjunction of subscriptions in where is the number of subscriptions is the number of distinct attributes in subscriptions and is the number of tests performed to answer subsumption question the probability of error is problem specific and typically very small and sets an upper bound on our experimental results show significant gains in term of subscription set reduction which has favorable impact on the overall system performance as it reduces the total computational costs and networking traffic furthermore the expected theoretical bounds underestimate algorithm performance because it performs much better in practice due to introduced optimizations and is adequate for fast forwarding of subscriptions in case of high subscription rate
previous research has shown that staged execution se ie dividing program into segments and executing each segment at the core that has the data and or functionality to best run that segment can improve performance and save power however se's benefit is limited because most segments access inter segment data ie data generated by the previous segment when consecutive segments run on different cores accesses to inter segment data incur cache misses thereby reducing performance this paper proposes data marshaling dm new technique to eliminate cache misses to inter segment data dm uses profiling to identify instructions that generate inter segment data and adds only bytes core of storage overhead we show that dm significantly improves the performance of two promising staged execution models accelerated critical sections and producer consumer pipeline parallelism on both homogeneous and heterogeneous multi core systems in both models dm can achieve almost all of the potential of ideally eliminating cache misses to inter segment data dm's performance benefit increases with the number of cores
power dissipation limits have emerged as major constraint in the design of microprocessors this is true not only at the low end where cost and battery life are the primary drivers but also now at the midrange and high end system server level thus the ability to estimate power consumption at the high level during the early stage definition and trade off studies is key new methodology enhancement sought by design and performance architects we first review the fundamentals in terms of power estimation and power performance trade offs at the microarchitecture level we then discuss the opportunities of saving power that can be exposed via microarchitecture level modeling in particular the potential savings that can be effected through straightforward clock gating techniques is cited as an example we also describe some future ideas and trends in power efficient processor design examples of how microarchitectural observations can be used toward power saving circuit design optimizations are described the design and modeling challenges are in the context of work in progress within ibm research this research is in support of future high end processor development within ibm
federated system is popular paradigm for multiple organizations to collaborate and share resources for common benefits in practice however these organizations are often within different administrative domains and thus demand autonomous resource management as opposed to blindly exporting their resources for efficient search to address these challenges we present new resource discovery middleware called roads that can facilitate voluntary sharing in roads the participants can associate with each other at their own will and dictate the extent of sharing by properly exporting summaries condensed representation of their resource records to enable efficient search these summaries are aggregated and replicated along an overlay assisted server hierarchy and the queries are routed to those servers that are likely to hold the desired resources our experimental results show that roads provides not only flexible resource sharing for federated systems but also efficient resource discovery with performance comparable to centrally managed system
in this paper we give brief history on conceptual modeling in computer science and we discuss state of the art approaches it is claimed that number of problems remain to be solved schema first is no longer viable approach to meet the data needs in the dynamic world of the internet and web services this is also true for the schema later approach simply because data and data sources constantly change in depth and breadth and can neither wait for the schema to be completed nor for the data to be collected as solution we advocate for new schema during approach in which the process of conceptual modeling is in continuum with the operations in the database
this paper is proposing new platform for implementing services in future service oriented architectures the basic premise of our proposal is that by combining the large volume of uncontracted resources with small clusters of dedicated resources we can dramatically reduce the amount of dedicated resources while the goodput provided by the overall system remains at high level this paper presents particular strategies for implementing this idea for particular class of applications we performed very detailed simulations on synthetic and real traces to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategies our findings on compute intensive applications show that preemptive reallocation of resources is necessary for assured services the proposed preemption based scheduling heuristic can significantly improve utilization of the dedicated resources by opportunistically offloading the peak loads on uncontracted resources while keeping the service quality virtually unaffected
we describe work in progress on tools and infrastructure to support adaptive component based software for mobile devices in our case apple iphones our high level aim is design for appropriation ie system design for uses and contexts that designers may not be able to fully predict or model in advance logs of users system operation are streamed back in real time to evaluators data visualisation tools so that they can assess design problems and opportunities evaluators and developers can then create new software components that are sent to the mobile devices these components are either integrated automatically on the fly or offered as recommendations for users to accept or reject by connecting developers users and evaluators we aim to quicken the pace of iterative design so as to improve the process of creating and sustaining contextually fitting software
feature subset selection has become an important challenge in areas of pattern recognition machine learning and data mining as different semantics are hidden in numerical and categorical features there are two strategies for selecting hybrid attributes discretizing numerical variables or numericalize categorical features in this paper we introduce simple and efficient hybrid attribute reduction algorithm based on generalized fuzzy rough model theoretic framework of fuzzy rough model based on fuzzy relations is presented which underlies foundation for algorithm construction we derive several attribute significance measures based on the proposed fuzzy rough model and construct forward greedy algorithm for hybrid attribute reduction the experiments show that the technique of variable precision fuzzy inclusion in computing decision positive region can get the optimal classification performance number of the selected features is the least but accuracy is the best
recent work has focused on creating models for generating traveler behavior for micro simulations with the increase in hand held computers and gps devices there is likely to be an increasing demand for extending this idea to predicting an individual's future travel plans for devices such as smart traveler's assistant in this work we introduce technique based on sequential data mining for predicting multiple aspects of an individual's next activity using combination of user history and their similarity to other travelers the proposed technique is empirically shown to perform better than more traditional approaches to this problem
we propose precomputation based approach for the real time rendering of scenes that include number of complex illumination phenomena such as radiosity and subsurface scattering and allows interactive modification of camera and lighting parameters at the heart of our approach lies novel parameterization of the rendering equation that is inherently supported by the modern gpu during the pre computation phase we build set of offset transfer maps based on the proposed parameterization which approximate the complete radiance transfer function for the scene the rendering phase is then reduced to set of texture blending and mapping operations that execute in real time on the gpu in contrast to the current state of the art which employs environment maps to produce global illumination our approach uses arbitrary first order lighting to compute final lighting solution and fully supports point and spot lights to discretize the transfer maps we develop an efficient method for generating and sampling continuous probability density functions from unordered data pointswe believe that the contributions of this paper offer significantly different approach to precomputed radiance transfer from those previously proposed

the postures character adopts over time are key expressive aspect of its movement while ik tools help character achieve positioning constraints there are few tools that help an animator with the expressive aspects of character's poses three aspects are required in good pose design achieving set of world space constraints finding body shape that reflects the character's inner state and personality and making adjustments to balance that act to strengthen the pose and also maintain realism this is routinely done in the performing arts but is uncommon in computer graphics our system combines all three components within single body shape solver the system combines feedback based balance control with hybrid ik system that utilizes optimization based and analytic ik components the ik system has been carefully designed to allow direct control over various aesthetically important aspects of body shape such as the type of curve in the spine and the relationship between the collar bones the system allows for both low level control and for higher level shape sets to be defined and used shape sets allow an animator to use single scalar to vary character's pose within specified shape class providing an intuitive parameterization of posture changing shape set allows an animator to quickly experiment with different posture options for movement sequence supporting rapid exploration of the aesthetic space

previous object code compression schemes have employed static and semiadaptive compression algorithms to reduce the size of instruction memory in embedded systems the suggestion by number of researchers that adaptive compression techniques are unlikely to yield satisfactory results for code compression has resulted in virtually no investigation of their application to that domain this paper presents new adaptive approach to code compression which operates at the granularity of program's cache lines where the context for compression is determined by an analysis of control flow in the code being compressed we introduce novel data structure the compulsory miss tree that is used to identify partial order in which compulsory misses will have occurred in an instruction cache whenever cache miss occurs this tree is used as basis for dynamically building and maintaining an lzw dictionary for compression decompression of individual instruction cache lines we applied our technique to eight benchmarks taken from the mibench and mediabench suites which were compiled with size optimization and subsequently compacted using link time optimizer prior to compressionresults from our experiments demonstrate object code size elimination averaging between and of the original linked code size depending on the cache line length under inspection
it is generally accepted that the management of imprecision and vagueness will yield more intelligent and realistic knowledge based applications in this paper we present fuzzy description logics framework based on certainty lattices our main feature is that an assertion is not just true or false like in classical description logics but certain to some degree where the certainty value is taken from certainty lattice we extend the well known fuzzy description logic based on fuzzy set theory shin to the fuzzy description logic based on certainty lattices theory shin the syntax semantics and logical properties of the shin are given and sound complete and terminating tableaux algorithm for deciding fuzzy abox consistency wrt rbox for the shin is presented in this paper various extensions of fuzzy description logics over lattices are also discussed
we extend fagin's result on the equivalence between functional dependencies in relational databases and propositional horn clauses it is shown that this equivalence still holds for functional dependencies in databases that support complex values via nesting of records lists sets and multisetsthe equivalence has several implications firstly it extends well known result from relational databases to databases which are not in first normal form secondly it characterises the implication of functional dependencies in complex value databases in purely logical terms the database designer can take advantage of this equivalence to reduce database design problems to simpler problems in propositional logic an algorithm is presented for such an application furthermore relational database design tools can be reused to solve problems for complex value databases

this paper presents scalable framework for real time raycasting of large unstructured volumes that employs hybrid bricking approach it adaptively combines original unstructured bricks in important focus regions with structured bricks that are resampled on demand in less important context regions the basis of this focus context approach is interactive specification of scalar degree of interest doi function thus rendering always considers two volumes simultaneously scalar data volume and the current doi volume the crucial problem of visibility sorting is solved by raycasting individual bricks and compositing in visibility order from front to back in order to minimize visual errors at the grid boundary it is always rendered accurately even for resampled bricks variety of different rendering modes can be combined including contour enhancement very important property of our approach is that it supports variety of cell types natively ie it is not constrained to tetrahedral grids even when interpolation within cells is used moreover our framework can handle multi variate data eg multiple scalar channels such as temperature or pressure as well as time dependent data the combination of unstructured and structured bricks with different quality characteristics such as the type of interpolation or resampling resolution in conjunction with custom texture memory management yields very scalable system

mining data streams of changing class distributions is important for real time business decision support the stream classifier must evolve to reflect the current class distribution this poses serious challenge on the one hand relying on historical data may increase the chances of learning obsolete models on the other hand learning only from the latest data may lead to biased classifiers as the latest data is often an unrepresentative sample of the current class distribution the problem is particularly acute in classifying rare events when for example instances of the rare class do not even show up in the most recent training data in this paper we use stochastic model to describe the concept shifting patterns and formulate this problem as an optimization one from the historical and the current training data that we have observed find the most likely current distribution and learn classifier based on the most likely distribution we derive an analytic solution and approximate this solution with an efficient algorithm which calibrates the influence of historical data carefully to create an accurate classifier we evaluate our algorithm with both synthetic and real world datasets our results show that our algorithm produces accurate and efficient classification

real time garbage collection rtgc has recently advanced to the point where it is being used in production for financial trading military command and control and telecommunications however among potential users of rtgc there is enormous diversity in both application requirements and deployment environments previously described rtgcs tend to work well in narrow band of possible environments leading to fragile systems and limiting adoption of real time garbage collection technology this paper introduces collector scheduling methodology called tax and spend and the collector design revisions needed to support it tax and spend provides general mechanism which works well across variety of application machine and operating system configurations tax and spend subsumes the predominant pre existing rtgc scheduling techniques it allows different policies to be applied in different contexts depending on the needs of the application virtual machines can co exist compositionally on single machine we describe the implementation of our system metronome ts as an extension of the metronome collector in ibm's real time virtual machine product and we evaluate it running on an way smp blade with real time linux kernel compared to the state of the art metronome system on which it is based implemented in the identical infrastructure it achieves almost shorter latencies comparable utilization at shorter time window and mean throughput improvements of
object oriented and object relational dbms support set valued attributes which are natural and concise way to model complex information however there has been limited research to date on the evaluation of query operators that apply on sets in this paper we study the join of two relations on their set valued attributes various join types are considered namely the set containment set equality and set overlap joins we show that the inverted file powerful index for selection queries can also facilitate the efficient evaluation of most join predicates we propose join algorithms that utilize inverted files and compare them with signature based methods for several set comparison predicates
power management is an important problem in battery powered sensor networks as the sensors are required to operate for long time usually several weeks to several months one of the challenges in developing power management protocols for sensor networks is prototyping specifically existing programming platforms for sensor networks eg nesc tinyos use an event driven programming model and hence require the designers to be responsible for stack management buffer management flow control etc therefore the designers simplify prototyping their solutions either by implementing their own discrete event simulators or by modeling them in specialized simulators to enable the designers to prototype power management protocols in target platform eg nesc tinyos in this paper we use prose programming tool for sensor networks prose enables the designers to specify their programs in simple abstract models while hiding low level challenges of sensor networks and programming level challenges as case study in this paper we specify power management protocol with prose automatically generate the corresponding nesc tinyos code and evaluate its performance based on the performance results we expect that prose enables the designers to rapidly prototype quickly deploy and easily evaluate their protocols

accurate feature detection and localization is fundamentally important to computer vision and feature locations act as input to many algorithms including camera calibration structure recovery and motion estimation unfortunately feature localizers in common use are typically not projectively invariant even in the idealized case of continuous image this results in feature location estimates that contain bias which can influence the higher level algorithms that make use of them while this behavior has been studied in the case of ellipse centroids and then used in practical calibration algorithm those results do not trivially generalize to the center of mass of radially symmetric intensity distribution this paper introduces the generalized result of feature location bias with respect to perspective distortion and applies it to several specific radially symmetric intensity distributions the impact on calibration is then evaluated finally an initial study is conducted comparing calibration results obtained using center of mass to those obtained with an ellipse detector results demonstrate that feature localization error over range of increasingly large projective distortions can be stabilized at less than tenth of pixel versus errors that can grow to larger than pixel in the uncorrected case
in order to maintain performance per watt in microprocessors there is shift towards the chip level multiprocessing paradigm microprocessor manufacturers are experimenting with tens of cores forecasting the arrival of hundreds of cores per single processor die in the near future with such large scale integration and increasing power densities thermal management continues to be significant design effort to maintain performance and reliability in modern process technologies in this paper we present two mechanisms to perform frequency scaling as part of dynamic frequency and voltage scaling dvfs to assist dynamic thermal management dtm our frequency selection algorithms incorporate the physical interaction of the cores on large scale system onto the emergency intervention mechanisms for temperature reduction of the hotspot while aiming to minimize the performance impact of frequency scaling on the core that is in thermal emergency our results show that our algorithm consistently succeeds in maximizing the operating frequency of the most critical core while successfully relieving the thermal emergency of the core comparison of our two alternative techniques reveals that our physical aware criticality based algorithm results in faster clock frequencies compared to our aggressive scaling algorithm we also show that our technique is extremely fast and is suited for real time thermal management
as means of transmitting not only data but also code encapsulated within functions higher order channels provide an advanced form of task parallelism in parallel computations in the presence of mutable references however they pose safety problem because references may be transmitted to remote threads where they are no longer valid this paper presents an ml like parallel language with type safe higher order channels by type safety we mean that no value written to channel contains references or equivalently that no reference escapes via channel from the thread where it is created the type system uses typing judgment that is capable of deciding whether the value to which term evaluates contains references or not the use of such typing judgment also makes it easy to achieve another desirable feature of channels channel locality that associates every channel with unique thread for serving all values addressed to it our type system permits mutable references in sequential computations and also ensures that mutable references never interfere with parallel computations thus it provides both flexibility in sequential programming and ease of implementing parallel computations
microarchitectures increasingly rely on dynamic optimization to improve performance in ways that are dif ficult or impossible for ahead of time compilers dynamic optimizers in turn require continuous portable low cost and accurate control flow profiles to inform their decisions but prior approaches have struggled to meet these goals simultaneously this paper presents pep hybrid instrumentation and sampling approach for continuous path and edge profiling that is efficient accurate and portable pep uses subset of ball larus path profiling to identify paths with low overhead and uses sampling to mitigate the expense of storing paths pep further reduces overhead by using profiling to guide instrumentation placement pep improves profile accuracy with modified version of arnold grove sampling the resulting system has average and maximum overhead path profile accuracy and edge profile accuracy on set of java benchmarks
query rewriting using views is technique that allows query to be answered efficiently by using pre computed materialized views it has many applications such as data caching query optimization schema integration etc this issue has been studied extensively for relational databases and as result the technology is maturing for xml data however the work is inadequate recently several frameworks have been proposed for query rewriting using views for xpath queries with the requirement that rewriting must be complete in this paper we study the problem of query rewriting using views for xpath queries without requiring that the rewriting be complete this will increase its applicability since in many cases complete rewritings using views do not exist we give formal definitions for various concepts to formulate the problem and then propose solutions our solutions are built under the framework for query containment we look into the problem from both theoretic perspectives and algorithmic approaches two methods to generate rewritings using views are proposed with different characteristics in terms of generalities and efficiencies the maximality properties of the rewritings generated by these methods are discussed
the combination of the cornea of an eye and camera viewing the eye form catadioptric mirror lens imaging system with very wide field of view we present detailed analysis of the characteristics of this corneal imaging system anatomical studies have shown that the shape of normal cornea without major defects can be approximated with an ellipsoid of fixed eccentricity and size using this shape model we can determine the geometric parameters of the corneal imaging system from the image then an environment map of the scene with large field of view can be computed from the image the environment map represents the illumination of the scene with respect to the eye this use of an eye as natural light probe is advantageous in many relighting scenarios for instance it enables us to insert virtual objects into an image such that they appear consistent with the illumination of the scene the eye is particularly useful probe when relighting faces it allows us to reconstruct the geometry of face by simply waving light source in front of the face finally in the case of an already captured image eyes could be the only direct means for obtaining illumination information we show how illumination computed from eyes can be used to replace face in an image with another one we believe that the eye not only serves as useful tool for relighting but also makes relighting possible in situations where current approaches are hard to use

the design of workflows is complicated task in those cases where the control flow between activities cannot be modeled in advance but simply occurs during enactment time run time we speak of ad hoc processes ad hoc processes allow for the flexibility needed in real life business processes since ad hoc processes are highly dynamic they represent one of the most difficult challenges both technically and conceptually caramba is one of the few process aware collaboration systems allowing for ad hoc processes unlike in classical workflow systems the users are no longer restricted by the system therefore it is interesting to study the actual way people and organizations work in this paper we propose process mining techniques and tools to analyze ad hoc processes we introduce process mining discuss the concept of mining in the context of ad hoc processes and demonstrate concrete application of the concept using caramba process mining tools such as emit and minson and newly developed extraction tool named teamlog
the proliferation of the world wide web has brought information retrieval ir techniques to the forefront of search technology to the average computer user ldquo searching rdquo now means using ir based systems for finding information on the www or in other document collections ir query evaluation methods and workloads differ significantly from those found in database systems in this paper we focus on three such differences first due to the inherent fuzziness of the natural language used in ir queries and documents an additional degree of flexibility is permitted in evaluating queries second ir query evaluation algorithms tend to have access patterns that cause problems for traditional buffer replacement policies third ir search is often an iterative process in which query is repeatedly refined and resubmitted by the user based on these differences we develop two complementary techniques to improve the efficiency of ir queries buffer aware query evaluation which alters the query evaluation process based on the current contents of buffers and ranking aware buffer replacement which incorporates knowledge of the query processing strategy into replacement decisions in detailed performance study we show that using either of these techniques yields significant performance benefits and that in many cases combining them produces even further improvements
novel junction detector is presented that fits the neighborhood around point to junction model the junction model segments the neighborhood into wedges by determining set of radial edges the radial edges are invariant to affine transforms creating an affine invariant junction detector the radial edges are evaluated based upon the pixels along the edge the angle between the pixel gradient and the vector to the potential junction point forms the initial basis for the measurement an initial set of radial edges is selected based upon identifying local maximums within given arc distance an energy function is applied to the resulting radial segmentation and greedy optimization routine is used to construct the minimal set of radial edges to identify the final junctions second energy function is used that combines the components of the first energy function with the resulting change in standard deviation by separation into radial segments the junctions with the most energy in their local neighborhoods are selected as potential junctions the neighborhoods about the potential junctions are analyzed to determine if they represent single line or multiple non parallel lines if the neighborhood represents multiple non parallel lines the point is classified as junction point the junction detector is tested on several images including both synthetic and real images highlights of radially segmented junction points are displayed for the real images

the nature of distributed systems is constantly and steadily changing as the hardware and software landscape evolves porting applications and adapting existing middleware systems to ever changing computational platforms has become increasingly complex and expensive therefore the design of applications as well as the design of next generation middleware systems must follow set of guiding principles in order to insure long term survivability without costly re engineering from our practical experience the key determinants to success in this endeavor are adherence to the following principles design for change provide for storage subsystem coordination employ workload partitioning and load balancing techniques employ caching schedule the workload and understand the workload in order to support these principles we have collected extensive experimental results comparing three middleware systems targeted at data and compute intensive applications implemented by our research group during the course of the last decade on single data and compute intensive application the main contribution of this work is the analysis of level playing field where we discuss and quantify how adherence to these guiding principles impacts overall system throughput and response time
optimization of complex xqueries combining many xpath steps and joins is currently hindered by the absence of good cardinality estimation and cost models for xquery additionally the state of the art of even relational query optimization still struggles to cope with cost model estimation errors that increase with plan size as well as with the effect of correlated joins and selections in this research we propose to radically depart from the traditional path of separating the query compilation and query execution phases by having the optimizer execute materialize partial results and use sampling based estimation techniques to observe the characteristics of intermediates the proposed technique takes as input join graph where the edges are either equi joins or xpath steps and the execution environment provides value and structural join algorithms as well as structural and value based indices while run time optimization with sampling removes many of the vulnerabilities of classical optimizers it brings its own challenges with respect to keeping resource usage under control both with respect to the materialization of intermediates as well as the cost of plan exploration using sampling our approach deals with these issues by limiting the run time search space to so called zero investment algorithms for which sampling can be guaranteed to be strictly linear in sample size all operators and xml value indices used by rox for sampling have the zero investment property we perform extensive experimental evaluation on large xml datasets that shows that our run time query optimizer finds good query plans in robust fashion and has limited run time overhead

space constrained optimization problems arise in variety of applications ranging from databases to ubiquitous computing typically these problems involve selecting set of items of interest subject to space constraint we show that in many important applications one faces variants of this basic problem in which the individual items are sets themselves and each set is associated with benefit value since there are no known approximation algorithms for these problems we explore the use of greedy and randomized techniques we present detailed performance and theoretical evaluation of the algorithms highlighting the efficiency of the proposed solutions
type inclusion test determines whether one type is subtype of another efficient type testing techniques exist for single subtyping but not for languages with multiple subtyping to date the fast constant time technique relies on binary matrix encoding of the subtype relation with quadratic space requirements in this paper we present three new encodings of the subtype relation the packed encoding the bit packed encoding and the compact encoding these encodings have different characteristics the bit packed encoding delivers the best compression rates on average for real life programs the packed encoding performs type inclusion tests in only machine instructions we present fast algorithm for computing these encoding which runs in less than milliseconds for pe and bpe and milliseconds for ce on an alpha processor finally we compare our results with other constant time type inclusion tests on suite of large benchmark hierarchies
the success of pp file sharing network highly depends on the scalability and versatility of its search mechanism two particularly desirable search features are scope ability to find infrequent items and support for partial match queries queries that contain typos or include subset of keywords while centralized index architectures such as napster can support both these features existing decentralized architectures seem to support at most one prevailing unstructured pp protocols such as gnutella and fasttrack deploy blind search mechanism where the set of peers probed is unrelated to the query thus they support partial match queries but have limited scope on the other extreme the recently proposed distributed hash tables dhts such as can and chord couple index location with the item's hash value and thus have good scope but can not effectively support partial match queries another hurdle to dhts deployment is their tight control of the overlay structure and the information part of the index each peer maintains which makes them more sensitive to failures and frequent joins and disconnects we develop new class of decentralized pp architectures our design is based on unstructured architectures such as gnutella and fasttrack and retains many of their appealing properties including support for partial match queries and relative resilience to peer failures yet we obtain orders of magnitude improvement in the efficiency of locating rare items our approach exploits associations inherent in human selections to steer the search process to peers that are more likely to have an answer to the query we demonstrate the potential of associative search using models analysis and simulations
we present clustering technique addressing redundancy for bounded distance clusters which means being able to determine the minimum number of cluster heads per node and the maximum distance from nodes to their cluster heads this problem is similar to computing dominating set ds of the network ds is defined as the problem of selecting minimum cardinality vertex set of the network such that every vertex not in is at distance smaller than or equal to from at least vertices in in mobile ad hoc networks manets clusters should be computed distributively because the topology may change frequently we present the first centralized and distributed solutions to the ds problem for arbitrary topologies the centralized algorithm computes kln approximation where is the largest cardinality among all hop neighborhoods in the network the distributed approach is extended for clustering applications while the centralized is used as lower bound for comparison purposes extensive simulations are used to compare the distributed solution with the centralized one as case study we propose novel multi core multicast protocol that applies the distributed solution for the election of cores the new protocol is compared against puma one of the best performing multicast protocols for manets simulation results show that the new protocol outperforms puma on the context of static networks

write buffering is one of many successful mechanisms that improves the performance and scalability of multiprocessors however it leads to more complex memory system behavior which cannot be described using intuitive consistency models such as sequential consistency it is crucial to provide programmers with specification of the exact behavior of such complex memories this article presents uniform framework for describing systems at different levels of abstraction and proving their equivalence the framework is used to derive and prove correct simple specifications in terms of program level instructions of the sparc total store order and partial store order memoriesthe framework is also used to examine the sparc relaxed memory order we show that it is not memory consistency model that corresponds to any implementation on multiprocessor that uses write buffers even though we suspect that the sparc version specification of relaxed memory order was intended to capture general write buffer architecture the same technique is used to show that coherence does not correspond to write buffer architecture corollary which follows from the relationship between coherence and alpha is that any implementation of alpha consistency using write buffers cannot produce all possible alpha computations that is there are some computations that satisfy the alpha specification but cannot occur in the given write buffer implementation

materialized views rdbms silver bullet demonstrate its efficacy in many applications especially as data warehousing decison support system tool the pivot of playing materialized views efficiently is view selection though studied for over thirty years in rdbms the selection is hard to make in the context of xml databases where both the semi structured data and the expressiveness of xml query languages add challenges to the view selection problem we start our discussion on producing minimal xml views in terms of size as candidates for given workload query set to facilitate intuitionistic view selection we present view graph called vcube to structurally maintain all generated views by basing our selection on vcube for materialization we propose two view selection strategies targeting at space optimized and space time tradeoff respectively we built our implementation on top of berkeley db xml demonstrating that significant performance improvement could be obtained using our proposed approaches
peer to peer overlay networks have proven to be good support for storing and retrieving data in fully decentralized way sound approach is to structure them in such way that they reflect the structure of the application peers represent objects of the application so that neighbours in the peer to peer network are objects having similar characteristics from the application's point of view such structured peer to peer overlay networks provide natural support for range queries while some complex structures such as voronoï tessellation where each peer is associated to cell in the space are clearly relevant to structure the objects the associated cost to compute and maintain these structures is usually extremely high for dimensions larger than we argue that an approximation of complex structure is enough to provide native support of range queries this stems from the fact that neighbours are important while the exact space partitioning associated to given peer is not as crucial in this paper we present the design analysis and evaluation of raynet loosely structured voronoï based overlay network raynet organizes peers in an approximation of voronoï tessellation in fully decentralized way it relies on monte carlo algorithm to estimate the size of cell and on an epidemic protocol to discover neighbours in order to ensure efficient polylogarithmic routing raynet is inspired from the kleinberg's small world model where each peer gets connected to close neighbours its approximate voronoï neighbours in raynet and shortcuts long range neighbours implemented using an existing kleinberg like peer sampling

several attempts have been made to analyze customer behavior on online commerce sites some studies particularly emphasize the social networks of customers users reviews and ratings of product exert effects on other consumers purchasing behavior whether user refers to other users ratings depends on the trust accorded by user to the reviewer on the other hand the trust that is felt by user for another user correlates with the similarity of two users ratings this bidirectional interaction that involves trust and rating is an important aspect of understanding consumer behavior in online communities because it suggests clustering of similar users and the evolution of strong communities this paper presents theoretical model along with analyses of an actual online commerce site we analyzed large community site in japan cosme the noteworthy characteristics of cosme are that users can bookmark their trusted users in addition they can post their own ratings of products which facilitates our analyses of the ratings bidirectional effects on trust and ratings we describe an overview of the data in cosme analyses of effects from trust to rating and vice versa and our proposition of measure of community gravity which measures how strongly user might be attracted to community our study is based on the cosme dataset in addition to the epinions dataset it elucidates important insights and proposes potentially important measure for mining online social networks
wireless sensor nodes are increasingly being tasked with computation and communication intensive functions while still subject to constraints related to energy availability on these embedded platforms once all low power design techniques have been explored duty cycling the various subsystems remains the primary option to meet the energy and power constraints this requires the ability to provide spurts of high mips and high bandwidth connections however due to the large overheads associated with duty cycling the computation and communication subsystems existing high performance sensor platforms are not efficient in supporting such an option in this article we present the design and optimizations taken in wireless gateway node wgn that bridges data from wireless sensor networks to wi fi networks in an on demand basis we discuss our strategies to reduce duty cycling related costs by partitioning the system and by reducing the amount of time required to activate or deactivate the high powered components we compare the design choices and performance parameters with those made in the intel stargate platform to show the effectiveness of duty cycling on our platform we have built working prototype and the experimental results with two different power management schemes show significant reductions in latency and average power consumption compared to the stargate the wgn running our power gating scheme performs about six times better in terms of average system power consumption than the stargate running the suspend system scheme for large working periods where the active power dominates for short working periods where the transition enable disable power becomes dominant we perform up to seven times better the comparative performance of our system is even greater when the sleep power dominates
separation logic is popular approach for specifying properties of recursive mutable data structures several existing systems verify subclass of separation logic specifications using static analysis techniques checking data structure specifications during program execution is an alternative to static verification it can enforce the sophisticated specifications for which static verification fails and it can help debug incorrect specifications and code by detecting concrete counterexamples to their validity this paper presents separation logic invariant checker slick runtime checker for separation logic specifications we show that although the recursive style of separation logic predicates is well suited for runtime execution the implicit footprint and existential quantification make efficient runtime checking challenging to address these challenges we introduce coloring technique for efficiently checking method footprints and describe techniques for inferring values of existentially quantified variables we have implemented our runtime checker in the context of tool for enforcing specifications of java programs our experience suggests that our runtime checker is useful companion to static verifier for separation logic specifications

in this paper we explore the relationship between preference elicitation learning style problem that arises in combinatorial auctions and the problem of learning via queries studied in computational learning theory preference elicitation is the process of asking questions about the preferences of bidders so as to best divide some set of goods as learning problem it can be thought of as setting in which there are multiple target concepts that can each be queried separately but where the goal is not so much to learn each concept as it is to produce an optimal example in this work we prove number of similarities and differences between two bidder preference elicitation and query learning giving both separation results and proving some connections between these problems

despite constant improvements in fabrication technology hardware components are consuming more power than ever with the ever increasing demand for higher performance in highly integrated systems and as battery technology falls further behind managing energy is becoming critically important to various embedded and mobile systems in this paper we propose and implement power aware virtual memory to reduce the energy consumed by the memory in response to workloads becoming increasingly data centric we can use the power management features in current memory technology to put individual memory devices into low power modes dynamically under software control to reduce the power dissipation however it is imperative that any techniques employed weigh memory energy savings against any potential energy increases in other system components due to performance degradation of the memory using novel power aware virtual memory implementation we estimate significant reduction in memory power dissipation from to based on rambus memory specifications while running various real world applications in working linux system unfortunately due to hardware bug in the chipset direct power measurement is currently not possible applying more advanced techniques we can reduce power dissipation further to depending on the actual workload with negligible effects on performance we also show this work is applicable to other memory architectures and is orthogonal to previously proposed hardware controlled power management techniques so it can be applied simultaneously to further enhance energy conservation in variety of platforms
in large scale networked computing systems component failures become norms instead of exceptions failure aware resource management is crucial for enhancing system availability and achieving high performance in this paper we study how to efficiently utilize system resources for high availability computing with the support of virtual machine vm technology we design reconfigurable distributed virtual machine rdvm infrastructure for networked computing systems we propose failure aware node selection strategies for the construction and reconfiguration of rdvms we leverage the proactive failure management techniques in calculating nodes reliability states we consider both the performance and reliability status of compute nodes in making selection decisions we define capacity reliability metric to combine the effects of both factors in node selection and propose best fit algorithms with optimistic and pessimistic selection strategies to find the best qualified nodes on which to instantiate vms to run user jobs we have conducted experiments using failure traces from production systems and the nas parallel benchmark programs on real world cluster system the results show the enhancement of system productivity by using the proposed strategies with practically achievable accuracy of failure prediction with the best fit strategies the job completion rate is increased by compared with that achieved in the current lanl hpc cluster the task completion rate reaches with utilization of relatively unreliable nodes
from design point of view coordination is radically undertheorized and under explored arguably playground games are the universal cross cultural venue in which people learn about and explore coordination between one another and between the worlds of articulated rules and the worlds of experience and action they can therefore teach us about the processes inherent in human coordination provide model of desirable coordinative possibilities and act as design framework from which to explore the relationship between game and game play or to put it in terms of an inherent tension in human computer interaction between plans and situated actions when brought together with computer language for coordination that helps us pare down coordinative complexity to essential components we can create systems that have highly distributed control structures in this paper we present the design of four such student created collaborative distributed interactive systems for face to face use these take their inspiration from playground games with respect to who can play plurality how appropriability and to what ends acompetitiveness as it happens our sample systems are themselves games however taking playground games as our model helps us create systems that support game play featuring not enforcement of plans but emergence of rules roles and turn taking
if conversion transforms control dependencies to data dependencies by using predication mechanism it is useful to eliminate hard to predict branches and to reduce the severe performance impact of branch mispredictions however the use of predicated execution in out of order processors has to deal with two problems there can be multiple definitions for single destination register at rename time and instructions with false predicated consume unnecessary resources predicting predicates is an effective approach to address both problems however predicting predicates that come from hard to predict branches is not beneficial in general because this approach reverses the if conversion transformation loosing its potential benefits in this paper we propose new scheme that dynamically selects which predicates are worthy to be predicted and which one are more effective in its if converted form we show that our approach significantly outperforms previous proposed schemes moreover it performs within of an ideal scheme with perfect predicate prediction

rdf schema rdfs as lightweight ontology language is gaining popularity and consequently tools for scalable rdfs inference and querying are needed sparql has become recently wc standard for querying rdf data but it mostly provides means for querying simple rdf graphs only whereas querying with respect to rdfs or other entailment regimes is left outside the current specification in this paper we show that sparql faces certain unwanted ramifications when querying ontologies in conjunction with rdf datasets that comprise multiple named graphs and we provide an extension for sparql that remedies these effects moreover since rdfs inference has close relationship with logic rules we generalize our approach to select custom ruleset for specifying inferences to be taken into account in sparql query we show that our extensions are technically feasible by providing benchmark results for rdfs querying in our prototype system giabata which uses datalog coupled with persistent relational database as back end for implementing sparql with dynamic rule based inference by employing different optimization techniques like magic set rewriting our system remains competitive with state of the art rdfs querying systems
the promise of rule based computing was to allow end users to create modify and maintain applications without the need to engage programmers but experience has shown that rule sets often interact in subtle ways making them difficult to understand and reason about this has impeded the widespread adoption of rule based computing this paper describes the design and implementation of xcellog user centered deductive spreadsheet system to empower non programmers to specify and manipulate rule based systems the driving idea underlying the system is to treat sets as the fundamental data type and rules as specifying relationships among sets and use the spreadsheet metaphor to create and view the materialized sets the fundamental feature that makes xcellog suitable for non programmers is that the user mainly sees the effect of the rules when rules or basic facts change the user sees the impact of the change immediately this enables the user to gain confidence in the rules and their modification and also experiment with what if scenarios without any programming preliminary experience with using xcellog indicates that it is indeed feasible to put the power of deductive spreadsheets for doing rule based computing into the hands of end users and do so without the requirement of programming or the constraints of canned application packages

major trend in modern system on chip design is growing system complexity which results in sharp increase of communication traffic on the on chip communication bus architectures in real time embedded system task arrival rate inter task arrival time and data size to be transferred are not uniform over time this is due to the partial re configuration of an embedded system to cope with dynamic workload in this context the traditional application specific bus architectures may fail to meet the real time constraints thus to incorporate the random behavior of on chip communication this work proposes an approach to synthesize an on chip bus architecture which is robust for given distributions of random tasks the randomness of communication tasks is characterized by three main parameters which are the average task arrival rate the average inter task arrival time and the data size for synthesis an on chip bus requirement is guided by the worst case performance need while the dynamic voltage scaling technique is used to save energy when the workload is low or timing slack is high this in turn results in an effective utilization of communication resources under variable workload

the objective of this article is to investigate the problem of generating both positive and negative exact association rules when formal context of positive attributes is provided straightforward solution to this problem consists of conducting an apposition of the initial context with its complementary context construct the concept lattice of apposed contexts and then extract rules more challenging problem consists of exploiting rules generated from each one of the contexts and to get the whole set of rules for the context in this paper we analyze set of identified situations based on distinct types of input and come out with set of properties obviously the global set of positive and negative rules is superset of purely positive rules ie rules with positive attributes only and purely negative ones since it generally contains mixed rules ie rules in which at least positive attribute and negative attribute coexist the paper presents also set of inference rules to generate subset of all mixed rules from positive negative and mixed ones finally two key conclusions can be drawn from our analysis the generic basis containing negative rules σk cannot be completely and directly inferred from the set σk of positive rules or from the concept lattice and ii the whole set of mixed rules may not be completely generated from σk alone σk σk alone or alone
the frequent pattern tree fp tree is an efficient data structure for association rule mining without generation of candidate itemsets it was used to compress database into tree structure which stored only large items it however needed to process all transactions in batch way in real world applications new transactions are usually incrementally inserted into databases in the past we proposed fast updated fp tree fufp tree structure to efficiently handle new transactions and to make the tree update process become easier in this paper we attempt to modify the fufp tree construction based on the concept of pre large itemsets pre large itemsets are defined by lower support threshold and an upper support threshold it does not need to rescan the original database until number of new transactions have been inserted the proposed approach can thus achieve good execution time for tree construction especially when each time small number of transactions are inserted experimental results also show that the proposed pre fufp maintenance algorithm has good performance for incrementally handling new transactions

we study oblivious routing in which the packet paths are constructed independently of each other we give simple oblivious routing algorithm for geometric networks in which the nodes are embedded in the euclidean plane in our algorithm packet path is constructed by first choosing random intermediate node in the space between the source and destination and then the packet is sent to its destination through the intermediate node we analyze the performance of the algorithm in terms of the stretch and congestion of the resulting paths we show that the stretch is constant and the congestion is near optimal when the network paths can be chosen to be close to the geodesic lines that connect the end points of the paths we give applications of our general result to the mesh topology and uniformly distributed disc graphs previous oblivious routing algorithms with near optimal congestion use many intermediate nodes and do not control the stretch
hardly predictable data addresses in many irregular applications have rendered prefetching ineffective in many cases the only accurate way to predict these addresses is to directly execute the code that generates them as multithreaded architectures become increasingly popular one attractive approach is to use idle threads on these machines to perform pre execution mdash essentially combined act of speculative address generation and prefetching mdash to accelerate the main thread in this paper we propose such pre execution technique for simultaneous multithreading smt processors by using software to control pre execution we are able to handle some of the most important access patterns that are typically difficult to prefetch compared with existing work on pre execution our technique is significantly simpler to implement eg no integration of pre execution results no need of shortening programs for pre execution and no need of special hardware to copy register values upon thread spawns consequently only minimal extensions to smt machines are required to support our technique despite its simplicity our technique offers an average speedup of in set of irregular applications which is speedup over state of the art software controlled prefetching
we propose texture function for realistic modeling and efficient rendering of materials that exhibit surface mesostructures translucency and volumetric texture variations the appearance of such complex materials for dynamic lighting and viewing directions is expensive to calculate and requires an impractical amount of storage to precompute to handle this problem our method models an object as shell layer formed by texture synthesis of volumetric material sample and homogeneous inner core to facilitate computation of surface radiance from the shell layer we introduce the shell texture function stf which describes voxel irradiance fields based on precomputed fine level light interactions such as shadowing by surface mesostructures and scattering of photons inside the object together with diffusion approximation of homogeneous inner core radiance the stf leads to fast and detailed raytraced renderings of complex materials

we present new approach for efficient collision handling of meshless objects undergoing geometric deformation the presented technique is based on bounding sphere hierarchies we show that information of the geometric deformation model can be used to significantly accelerate the hierarchy update the cost of the presented hierarchy update depends on the number of primitives in close proximity but not on the total number of primitives further the hierarchical collision detection is combined with level of detail response scheme since the collision response can be performed on any level of the hierarchy it allows for balancing accuracy and efficiency thus the collision handling scheme is particularly useful for time critical applications

this paper describes the techniques used to optimize relational queries in the sdd distributed database system queries are submitted to sdd in high level procedural language called datalanguage optimization begins by translating each datalanguage query into relational calculus form called an envelope which is essentially an aggregate free quel query this paper is primarily concerned with the optimization of envelopes envelopes are processed in two phases the first phase executes relational operations at various sites of the distributed database in order to delimit subset of the database that contains all data relevant to the envelope this subset is called reduction of the database the second phase transmits the reduction to one designated site and the query is executed locally at that site the critical optimization problem is to perform the reduction phase efficiently success depends on designing good repertoire of operators to use during this phase and an effective algorithm for deciding which of these operators to use in processing given envelope against given database the principal reduction operator that we employ is called semijoin in this paper we define the semijoin operator explain why semijoin is an effective reduction operator and present an algorithm that constructs cost effective program of semijoins given an envelope and database
the effectiveness of information retrieval ir systems is influenced by the degree of term overlap between user queries and relevant documents query document term mismatch whether partial or total is fact that must be dealt with by ir systems query expansion qe is one method for dealing with term mismatch ir systems implementing query expansion are typically evaluated by executing each query twice with and without query expansion and then comparing the two result sets while this measures an overall change in performance it does not directly measure the effectiveness of ir systems in overcoming the inherent issue of term mismatch between the query and relevant documents nor does it provide any insight into how such systems would behave in the presence of query document term mismatch in this paper we propose new approach for evaluating query expansion techniques the proposed approach is attractive because it provides an estimate of system performance under varying degrees of query document term mismatch it makes use of readily available test collections and it does not require any additional relevance judgments or any form of manual processing
this paper considers the problem of self diagnosis of wireless and mobile ad hoc networks manets using the comparison approach in this approach network manet consists of collection of independent heterogeneous mobile or stationary hosts interconnected via wireless links and it is assumed that at most of these hosts are faulty in order to diagnose the state of the manet tasks are assigned to pairs of hosts and the outcomes of these tasks are compared the agreements and disagreements between the hosts are the basis for identifying the faulty ones the comparison approach is believed to be one of the most practical fault identification approaches for diagnosing hard and soft faults we develop new distributed self diagnosis protocol called dynamic dsdp for manets that identifies both hard and soft faults in finite amount of time the protocol is constructed on top of reliable multi hop architecture correctness and complexity proofs are provided and they show that our dynamic dsdp performs better from communication complexity viewpoint than the existing protocols we have also developed simulator that is scalable to large number of nodes using the simulator we carried out simulation study to analyze the effectiveness of the self diagnosis protocol and its performance with regards to the number of faulty hosts the simulation results show that the proposed approach is an attractive and viable alternative or addition to present fault diagnosis techniques in manet environments

recent work on incremental crawling has enabled the indexed document collection of search engine to be more synchronized with the changing world wide web however this synchronized collection is not immediately searchable because the keyword index is rebuilt from scratch less frequently than the collection can be refreshed an inverted index is usually used to index documents crawled from the web complete index rebuild at high frequency is expensive previous work on incremental inverted index updates have been restricted to adding and removing documents updating the inverted index for previously indexed documents that have changed has not been addressedin this paper we propose an efficient method to update the inverted index for previously indexed documents whose contents have changed our method uses the idea of landmarks together with the diff algorithm to significantly reduce the number of postings in the inverted index that need to be updated our experiments verify that our landmark diff method results in significant savings in the number of update operations on the inverted index
despite improvements in network interfaces and software messaging layers software communication overhead still dominates the hardware routing cost in most systems in this study we identify the sources of this overhead by analyzing software costs of typical communication protocols built atop the active messages layer on the cm we show that up to ndash of the software messaging costs are direct consequence of the gap between specific network features such as arbitrary delivery order finite buffering and limited fault handling and the user communication requirements of in order delivery end to end flow control and reliable transmission however virtually all of these costs can be eliminated if routing networks provide higher level services such as in order delivery end to end flow control and packet level fault tolerance we conclude that significant cost reductions require changing the constraints on messaging layers we propose designing networks and network interfaces which simplify or replace software for implementing user communication requirements
the aim of this study was to empirically evaluate an embodied conversational agent called greta in an effort to answer two main questions what are the benefits and costs of presenting information via an animated agent with certain characteristics in persuasion task compared to other forms of display how important is it that emotional expressions are added in way that is consistent with the content of the message in animated agents to address these questions positively framed healthy eating message was created which was variously presented via greta matched human actor greta's voice only no face or as text only furthermore versions of greta were created which displayed additional emotional facial expressions in way that was either consistent or inconsistent with the content of the message overall it was found that although greta received significantly higher ratings for helpfulness and likability presenting the message via greta led to the poorest memory performance among users importantly however when greta's additional emotional expressions were consistent with the content of the verbal message the negative effect on memory performance disappeared overall the findings point to the importance of achieving consistency in animated agents
scalable busy wait synchronization algorithms are essential for achieving good parallel program performance on large scale multiprocessors such algorithms include mutual exclusion locks reader writer locks and barrier synchronization unfortunately scalable synchronization algorithms are particularly sensitive to the effects of multiprogramming their performance degrades sharply when processors are shared among different applications or even among processes of the same application in this paper we describe the design and evaluation of scalable scheduler conscious mutual exclusion locks reader writer locks and barriers and show that by sharing information across the kernel application interface we can improve the performance of scheduler oblivious implementations by more than an order of magnitude

many modern applications have significant operating system os component the os execution affects various architectural states including the dynamic branch predictions which are widely used in today's high performance microprocessor designs to improve performance this impact tends to become more significant as the designs become more deeply pipelined and more speculative in this paper we focus on the issues of understanding the os effects on the branch predictions and designing architectural support to alleviate the bottlenecks that are created by misprediction in this work we characterize the control flow transfer of several emerging applications on commercial os it was observed that the exception driven intermittent invocation of os code and user os branch history interference increased misprediction in both user and kernel code we propose two simple os aware control flow prediction techniques to alleviate the destructive impact of user os branch interference the first consists of capturing separate branch correlation information for user and kernel code the second involves using separate branch prediction tables for user and kernel code we demonstrate in this paper that os aware branch predictions require minimal hardware modifications and additions moreover the os aware branch predictions can be integrated with many existing schemes to further improve their performance we studied the improvement contributed by os aware techniques to various branch prediction schemes ranging from the simple gshare to the more advanced agree multi hybrid and bi mode predictors on the entry predictors incorporating the os aware techniques yields up to percent percent percent and percent prediction accuracy improvement on the gshare multi hybrid agree and bi mode predictors respectively
many recent studies have convincingly demonstrated that network traffic exhibits noticeable self similar nature which has considerable impact on queuing performance however the networks used in current multicomputers have been primarily designed and analyzed under the assumption of the traditional poisson arrival process which is inherently unable to capture traffic self similarity consequently it is crucial to reexamine the performance properties of multicomputer networks in the context of more realistic traffic models before practical implementations show their potential faults in an effort toward this end this paper proposes the first analytical model for wormhole switched ary cubes in the presence of self similar traffic simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits good degree of accuracy for various system sizes and under different operating conditions the analytical model is then used to investigate the implications of traffic self similarity on network performance this study reveals that the network suffers considerable performance degradation when subjected to self similar traffic stressing the great need for improving network performance to ensure efficient support for this type of traffic
actions usually taken to prevent processors from overheating such as decreasing the frequency or stopping the execution flow also degrade performance multiprocessor systems however offer the possibility of moving the task that caused cpu to overheat away to some other cooler cpu so throttling becomes only last resort taken if all of system's processors are hot additionally the scheduler can take advantage of the energy characteristics of individual tasks and distribute hot tasks as well as cool tasks evenly among all cpusthis work presents mechanism for determining the energy characteristics of tasks by means of event monitoring counters and an energy aware scheduling policy that strives to assign tasks to cpus in way that avoids overheating individual cpus our evaluations show that the benefit of avoiding throttling outweighs the overhead of additional task migrations and that energy aware scheduling in many cases increases the system's throughput
in recent years computer and internet technologies have broadened the ways that people can stay in touch through interviews with parents and grandparents we examined how people use existing technologies to communicate and share with their extended family while most of our participants expressed desire for more communication and sharing with their extended family many felt that an increase would realistically be difficult to achieve due to challenges such as busy schedules or extended family members lack of technology use our results also highlight the complexity of factors that researchers and designers must understand when attempting to design technology to support and enhance relationships including trade offs between facilitating interaction while minimizing new obligations reducing effort without trivializing communication and balancing awareness with privacy

reprogramming of sensor networks is an important and challenging problem as it is often necessary to reprogram the sensors in place in this article we propose mnp multihop reprogramming service designed for sensor networks one of the problems in reprogramming is the issue of message collision to reduce the problem of collision we propose sender selection algorithm that attempts to guarantee that in given neighborhood there is at most one source transmitting the program at time furthermore our sender selection is greedy in that it tries to select the sender that is expected to have the most impact we use pipelining to enable fast data propagation mnp is energy efficient because it reduces the active radio time of sensor node by putting the node into ldquo sleep rdquo state when its neighbors are transmitting segment that is not of interest we call this type of sleep contention sleep to further reduce the energy consumption we add noreq sleep where sensor node goes to sleep if none of its neighbors is interested in receiving the segment it is advertising we also introduce an optional init sleep to reduce the energy consumption in the initial phase of reprogramming finally we investigate the performance of mnp in different network settings

when program violates its specification model checker produces counterexample that shows an example of undesirable behavior it is up to the user to understand the error locate it and fix the problem previous work introduced technique for explaining and localizing errors based on finding the closest execution to counterexample with respect to distance metric that approach was applied only to concrete executions of programs this paper extends and generalizes the approach by combining it with predicate abstraction using an abstract state space increases scalability and makes explanations more informative differences between executions are presented in terms of predicates derived from the specification and program rather than specific changes to variable values reasoning to the cause of an error from the factthat in the failing run but in the successful execution is easier than reasoning from the information that in the failing run but in the successful execution an abstract explanation is automatically generalized predicate abstraction has previously been used in model checking purely as state space reduction technique however an abstraction good enough to enable model checking tool to find an error is also likely to be useful as an automatically generated high level description of state space suitable for use by programmers results demonstrating the effectiveness of abstract explanations support this claim

steady progress in the development of optical disc technology over the past decade has brought it to the point where it is beginning to compete directly with magnetic disc technology worm optical discs in particular which permanently register information on the disc surface have significant advantages over magnetic technology for applications that are mainly archival in nature but require the ability to do frequent on line insertions in this paper we propose class of access methods that use rewritable storage for the temporary buffering of insertions to data sets stored on worm optical discs and we examine the relationship between the retrieval performance from worm optical discs and the utilization of disc storage space when one of these organizations is employed we describe the performance trade off as one of fast sequential retrieval of the contents of block versus wasted space owing to data replication model of specific instance of such an organization buffered hash file scheme is described that allows for the specification of retrieval performance objectives alternative strategies for managing data replication that allow trade offs between higher consumption rates and better average retrieval performance are also described we then provide an expected value analysis of the amount of disc space that must be consumed on worm disc to meet specified performance limits the analysis is general enough to allow easy extension to other types of buffered files systems for worm optical discs
there are many applications for which it is necessary to illustrate motion in static image using visual cues which do not represent physical entity in the scene yet are widely understood to convey motion for example consider the task of illustrating the desired movements for exercising dancing or given sport technique traditional artists have developed techniques to specify desired movements precisely technical illustrators and suggest motion cartoonists in an image in this paper we present an interactive system to synthesize image of an animated character by generating artist inspired motion cues derived from skeletal motion capture data the primary cues include directed arrows noise waves and stroboscopic motion first the user decomposes the animation into short sequences containing individual motions which can be represented by visual cues the system then allows the user to determine suitable viewpoint for illustrating the movement to select the proper level in the joint hierarchy as well as to fine tune various controls for the depiction of the cues themselves while the system does provide adapted default values for each control extracted from the motion capture data it allows fine tuning for greater expressiveness moreover these cues are drawn in real time and maintain coherent display with changing viewpoints we demonstrate the benefit of our interactive system on various motion capture sequences
in many data mining and machine learning problems the data items that need to be clustered or classified are not arbitrary points in high dimensional space but are distributions that is points on high dimensional simplex for distributions natural measures are not ell distances but information theoretic measures such as the kullback leibler and hellinger divergences similarly quantities such as the entropy of distribution are more natural than frequency moments efficient estimation of these quantities is key component in algorithms for manipulating distributions since the datasets involved are typically massive these algorithms need to have only sublinear complexity in order to be feasible in practice we present range of sublinear time algorithms in various oracle models in which the algorithm accesses the data via an oracle that supports various queries in particular we answer question posed by batu et al on testing whether two distributions are close in an information theoretic sense given independent samples we then present optimal algorithms for estimating various information divergences and entropy with more powerful oracle called the combined oracle that was also considered by batu et al finally we consider sublinear space algorithms for these quantities in the data stream model in the course of doing so we explore the relationship between the aforementioned oracle models and the data stream model this continues work initiated by feigenbaum et al an important additional component to the study is considering data streams that are ordered randomly rather than just those which are ordered adversarially

using mixture of random variables to model data is tried and tested method common in data mining machine learning and statistics by using mixture modeling it is often possible to accurately model even complex multimodal data via very simple components however the classical mixture model assumes that data point is generated by single component in the model lot of datasets can be modeled closer to the underlying reality if we drop this restriction we propose probabilistic framework the mixture of subsets mos model by making two fundamental changes to the classical mixture model first we allow data point to be generated by set of components rather than just single component next we limit the number of data attributes that each component can influence we also propose an em framework to learn the mos model from dataset and experimentally evaluate it on real high dimensional datasets our results show that the mos model learned from the data represents the underlying nature of the data accurately

many organizations rely on web applications that use back end databases to store important data testing such applications requires significant effort manual testing alone is often impractical so testers also rely on automated testing techniques however current automated testing techniques may produce false positives or false negatives even in perfectly working system because the outcome of test case depends on the state of the database which changes over time as data is inserted and deleted the automatic database tester autodbt generates functional test cases that account for database updates autodbt takes as input model of the application and set of testing criteria the model consists of state transition diagram that shows how users navigate pages data specification that captures how data flows and an update specification that shows how the database is updated autodbt generates guard queries to determine whether the database is in state conducive to performing and evaluating tests autodbt also generates partial oracles to help validate whether back end database is updated correctly during testing this paper describes the design of autodbt prototype implementation several experiments with the prototype and four case studies
hyperlinks are an essential feature of the world wide web highly responsible for its success xlink improves on html's linking capabilities in several ways in particular links after xlink can be out of line ie not defined at link source and collected in possibly several linkbases which considerably ease building complex link structuresregarding its architecture as distributed and open system the web differs significantly from traditional hypermedia systems modeling of link structures and processing of linkbases under the web's open world linking require rethinking the traditional approaches this unfortunately has been rather neglected in the design of xlinkadding notion of interface to xlink as suggested in this work can considerably improve modeling of link structures when link structure is traversed the relevant linkbase might become ambiguous we suggest three linkbase management modes governing the binding of linkbase to document to resolve this ambiguity

in wormhole meshes reliable routing is supposed to be deadlock free and fault tolerant many routing algorithms are able to tolerate large number of faults enclosed by rectangular blocks or special convex none of them however is capable of handling two convex fault regions with distance two by using only two virtual networks in this paper fault tolerant wormhole routing algorithm is presented to tolerate the disjointed convex faulty regions with distance two or no less which do not contain any nonfaulty nodes and do not prohibit any routing as long as nodes outside faulty regions are connected in the mesh network the processors overlapping along the boundaries of different fault regions is allowed the proposed algorithm which routes the messages by routing algorithm in fault free region can tolerate convex fault connected regions with only two virtual channels per physical channel and is deadlock and livelock free the proposed algorithm can be easily extended to adaptive routing
natural time dependent similarity measure for two trajectories is their average distance at corresponding times we give algorithms for computing the most similar subtrajectories under this measure assuming the two trajectories are given as two polygonal possibly self intersecting lines when minimum duration is specified for the subtrajectories and they must start at exactly corresponding times in the input trajectories we give linear time algorithm for computing the starting time and duration of the most similar subtrajectories the algorithm is based on result of independent interest we present linear time algorithm to find for piece wise monotone function an interval of at least given length that has minimum average value when the two subtrajectories can start at different times in the two input trajectories it appears difficult to give an exact algorithm for the most similar subtrajectories problem even if the duration of the desired two subtrajectories is fixed to some length we show that the problem can be solved approximately and with performance guarantee more precisely we present epsilon approximation algorithms for computing the most similar subtrajectories of two input trajectories for the case where the duration is specified and also for the case where only minimum on the duration is specified

in this paper we describe study that explored the implications of the social translucence framework for designing systems that support communications at work two systems designed for communicating availability status were empirically evaluated to understand what constitutes successful way to achieve visibility of people's communicative state some aspects of the social translucence constructs visibility awareness and accountability were further operationalized into questionnaire and tested relationships between these constructs through path modeling techniques we found that to improve visibility systems should support people in presenting their status in contextualized yet abstract manner visibility was also found to have an impact on awareness and accountability but no significant relationship was seen between awareness and accountability we argue that to design socially translucent systems it is insufficient to visualize people's availability status it is also necessary to introduce mechanisms stimulating mutual awareness that allow for maintaining shared reciprocical knowledge about communicators availability state which then can encourage them to act in socially responsible way

we introduce green coordinates for closed polyhedral cages the coordinates are motivated by green's third integral identity and respect both the vertices position and faces orientation of the cage we show that green coordinates lead to space deformations with shape preserving property in particular in they induce conformal mappings and extend naturally to quasi conformal mappings in in both cases we derive closed form expressions for the coordinates yielding simple and fast algorithm for cage based space deformation we compare the performance of green coordinates with those of mean value coordinates and harmonic coordinates and show that the advantage of the shape preserving property is not achieved at the expense of speed or simplicity we also show that the new coordinates extend the mapping in natural analytic manner to the exterior of the cage allowing the employment of partial cages

possibilistic defeasible logic programming delp is logic programming language which combines features from argumentation theory and logic programming incorporating the treatment of possibilistic uncertainty at the object language level in spite of its expressive power an important limitation in delp is that imprecise fuzzy information cannot be expressed in the object language one interesting alternative for solving this limitation is the use of pgl possibilistic logic over godel logic extended with fuzzy constants fuzzy constants in pgl allow expressing disjunctive information about the unknown value of variable in the sense of magnitude modelled as unary predicate the aim of this article is twofold firstly we formalize depgl possibilistic defeasible logic programming language that extends delp through the use of pgl in order to incorporate fuzzy constants and fuzzy unification mechanism for them secondly we propose way to handle conflicting arguments in the context of the extended framework
the system administrators of large organizations often receive large number of mails from its users and substantial amount of effort is devoted to reading and responding to these mails the content of these messages can range from trivial technical questions to complex problem reports often these queries can be classified into specific categories for example reports of file system that is full or requests to change the toner in particular printer in this project we have experimented with text mining techniques and developed tool for automatically classifying user mail queries in real time and pseudo automatically responding to these requests our experimental evaluations suggest that one cannot completely rely on totally automatic tool for sorting and responding to incoming mail however it can be resource saving compliment to an existing toolset that can increase the support efficiency and quality
fast instruction decoding is challenge for the design of cisc microprocessors well known solution to overcome this problem is using trace cache it stores and fetches already decoded instructions avoiding the need for decoding them again however implementing trace cache involves an important increase in the fetch architecture complexityin this paper we propose novel decoding architecture that reduces the fetch engine implementation cost instead of using special purpose buffer like the trace cache our proposal stores frequently decoded instructions in the memory hierarchy the address where the decoded instructions are stored is kept in the branch prediction mechanism enabling it to guide our decoding architecture this makes it possible for the processor front end to fetch already decoded instructions from memory instead of the original nondecoded instructions our results show that an wide superscalar processor achieves an average performance improvement by using our decoding architecture this improvement is comparable to the one achieved by using the more complex trace cache while requiring less chip area and less energy consumption in the fetch architecture
this article describes general purpose program analysis that computes global control flow and data flow information for higher order call by value languages the analysis employs novel form of polyvariance called polymorhic splitting that uses let expressions as syntactic clues to gain precision the information derived from the analysis is used both to eliminate run time checks and to inline procedure the analysis and optimizations have been applied to suite of scheme programs experimental results obtained from the prototype implementation indicate that the analysis is extremely precise and has reasonable cost compared to monovariant flow analyses such as cfa or analyses based on type inference such as soft typing the analysis eliminates significantly more run time checks run time check elimination and inlining together typically yield to performance improvement for the benchmark suite with some programs running four times as fast
organising large scale web information retrieval systems into hierarchies of topic specific search resources can improve both the quality of results and the efficient use of computing resources promising way to build such systems involves federations of topic specific search engines in decentralised search environments most of the previous research concentrated on various technical aspects of such environments eg routing of search queries or merging of results from multiple sources we focus on organisational dynamics what happens to topical specialisation of search engines in the absence of centralised control when each engine makes individual and self interested decisions on its service parameters we investigate this question in computational economics framework where search providers compete for user queries by choosing what topics to index we provide formalisation of the competition problem and then analyse theoretically and empirically the specialisation dynamics of such systems
adaptive body biasing abb is popularly used technique to mitigate the increasing impact of manufacturing process variations on leakage power dissipation the efficacy of the abb technique can be improved by partitioning design into number of body bias islands each with its individual body bias voltage in this paper we propose system level leakage variability mitigation framework to partition multiprocessor system into body bias islands at the processing element pe granularity at design time and to optimally assign body bias voltages to each island post fabrication as opposed to prior gate and circuit level partitioning techniques that constrain the global clock frequency of the system we allow each island to run at different speed and constrain only the relevant system performance metrics in our case the execution deadlines experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed framework in reducing the mean and standard deviation of leakage power dissipation compared to baseline system without abb at the same time the proposed techniques provide significant runtime improvements over previously proposed monte carlo based technique while providing similar reductions in leakage power dissipation
it is well known that web page classification can be enhanced by using hyperlinks that provide linkages between web pages however in the web space hyperlinks are usually sparse noisy and thus in many situations can only provide limited help in classification in this paper we extend the concept of linkages from explicit hyperlinks to implicit links built between web pages by observing that people who search the web with the same queries often click on different but related documents together we draw implicit links between web pages that are clicked after the same queries those pages are implicitly linked we provide an approach for automatically building the implicit links between web pages using web query logs together with thorough comparison between the uses of implicit and explicit links in web page classification our experimental results on large dataset confirm that the use of the implicit links is better than using explicit links in classification performance with an increase of more than in terms of the macro measurement
in march sigcse members contributed to mailing list discussion on the question of whether programming should be taught objects first or imperative first we analyse that discussion exploring how the cs community debates the issue and whether contributors positions are supported by the research literature on novice programmers we applied four distinct research methods to the discussion cognitive science rhetorical analysis in the critical tradition phenomenography and biography we identify the cognitive claims made in the email discussion and find there is not consensus in the research literature as to whether the objects first approach or the imperative approach is harder to learn from the rhetorical analysis we find that the discussion was not so much debate between oo first versus imperative first but instead was more for and against oo first our phenomenographic analysis identified and categorized the underlying complexity of the discussion we also applied biographical method to explore the extent to which the participants views are shaped by their own prior experience the paper concludes with some reflections upon paradigms and the manner in which the cs discipline community defines itself
the well definedness problem for database query language consists of checking given an expression and an input type that the expression never yields runtime error on any input adhering to the input type in this article we study the well definedness problem for query languages on trees that are built from finite set of partially defined base operations by adding variables constants conditionals let bindings and iteration we identify properties of base operations that can make the problem undecidable and give restrictions that are sufficient to ensure decidability as direct result we obtain large fragment of xquery for which well definedness is decidable
one promising approach for adding object oriented oo facilities to functional languages like ml is to generalize the existing datatype and function constructs to be hierarchical and extensible so that datatype variants simulate classes and function cases simulate methods this approach allows existing datatypes to be easily extended with both new operations and new variants resolving longstanding conflict between the functional and oo styles however previous designs based on this approach have been forced to give up modular typechecking requiring whole program checks to ensure type safety we describe extensible ml eml an ml like language that supports hierarchical extensible datatypes and functions while preserving purely modular typechecking to achieve this result eml's type system imposes few requirements on datatype and function extensibility but eml is still able to express both traditional functional and oo idioms we have formalized core version of eml and proven the associated type system sound and we have developed prototype interpreter for the language
in this paper we propose deferred workload based inter task dvs dynamic voltage scaling algorithm dwdvs which has two features for portable multimedia devices the first is that we reserve time interval for each task to execute and its workload can be completed in this time interval even in the worst case condition which means that the actual workload execution time of each task is equal to its worst case execution time in this way we can estimate the slack time from lower priority tasks more aggressively the second is that we defer these reserved time intervals which means that reserved time interval will be shifted to the deadline of its corresponding task as close as possible thus the operating frequency can be reduced even without slack time simulation results show that the proposed dwdvs reduces the energy consumption by and compared with the static voltage scaling static laedf and dra algorithms respectively and approaches theoretical low bound bound by margin of at most
during the iterative development of interactive software formative evaluation is often performed to find and fix usability problems early on the output of formative evaluation usually takes the form of prioritised list of usability findings each finding typically consisting of description of the problem how often it occurred and sometimes recommendation for possible solution unfortunately the valuable results of formative evaluations are usually collected into written document this makes it extremely difficult to automate the handling of usability findings more formalised electronic format for the handover of usability findings would make much more sense usabml is formalised structure for reporting usability findings expressed in xml it allows usability experts and software engineers to import usability findings into bug issue tracking systems to associate usability issues with parts of source code and to track progress in fixing them
almost all actions on computer are mediated by windows yet we know surprisingly little about how people coordinate their activities using these windows studies of window use are difficult for two reasons gathering longitudinal data is problematic and it is unclear how to extract meaningful characterisations from the data in this paper we present visualisation tool called window watcher that helps researchers understand and interpret low level event logs of window switching activities generated by our tool pylogger we describe its design objectives and demonstrate ways that it summarises and elucidates window use
many interactive systems require users to navigate through large sets of data and commands using constrained input devices mdash such as scroll rings rocker switches or specialized keypads mdash that provide less power and flexibility than traditional input devices like mice or touch screens while performance with more traditional devices has been extensively studied in human computer interaction there has been relatively little investigation of human performance with constrained input as result there is little understanding of what factors govern performance in these situations and how interfaces should be designed to optimize interface actions such as navigation and selection since constrained input is now common in wide variety of interactive systems such as mobile phones audio players in car navigation systems and kiosk displays it is important for designers to understand what factors affect performance to aid in this understanding we present the constrained input navigation cin model predictive model that allows accurate determination of human navigation and selection performance in constrained input scenarios cin identifies three factors that underlie user efficiency the performance of the interface type for single level item selection where interface type depends on the input and output devices the interactive behavior and the data organization the hierarchical structure of the information space and the user's experience with the items to be selected we show through experiments that after empirical calibration the model's predictions fit empirical data well and discuss why and how each of the factors affects performance models like cin can provide valuable theoretical and practical benefits to designers of constrained input systems allowing them to explore and compare much wider variety of alternate interface designs without the need for extensive user studies
this paper provides logical framework of negotiating agents who have capabilities of evaluating and building proposals given proposal an agent decides whether it is acceptable or not if the proposal is unacceptable as it is the agent seeks conditions to accept it this attitude is captured as process of making hypotheses by induction if an agent fails to find hypothesis it would concede by giving up some of its current belief this attitude is characterized using default reasoning we provide logical framework of such think act cycle of an agent and develop method for computing proposals using answer set programming
training statistical machine translation starts with tokenizing parallel corpus some languages such as chinese do not incorporate spacing in their writing system which creates challenge for tokenization moreover morphologically rich languages such as korean present an even bigger challenge since optimal token boundaries for machine translation in these languages are often unclear both rule based solutions and statistical solutions are currently used in this paper we present unsupervised methods to solve tokenization problem our methods incorporate information available from parallel corpus to determine good tokenization for machine translation
we present the first verification of full functional correctness for range of linked data structure implementations including mutable lists trees graphs and hash tables specifically we present the use of the jahob verification system to verify formal specifications written in classical higher order logic that completely capture the desired behavior of the java data structure implementations with the exception of properties involving execution time and or memory consumption given that the desired correctness properties include intractable constructs such as quantifiers transitive closure and lambda abstraction it is challenge to successfully prove the generated verification conditions our jahob verification system uses integrated reasoning to split each verification condition into conjunction of simpler subformulas then apply diverse collection of specialized decision procedures first order theorem provers and in the worst case interactive theorem provers to prove each subformula techniques such as replacing complex subformulas with stronger but simpler alternatives exploiting structure inherently present in the verification conditions and when necessary inserting verified lemmas and proof hints into the imperative source code make it possible to seamlessly integrate all of the specialized decision procedures and theorem provers into single powerful integrated reasoning system by appropriately applying multiple proof techniques to discharge different subformulas this reasoning system can effectively prove the complex and challenging verification conditions that arise in this context
today the world wide web is undergoing subtle but profound shift to web and semantic web technologies due to the increasing interest in the semantic web more and more semantic web applications are being developed one of the current main issues facing the development of semantic web applications is the simplicity and user friendliness for the end users especially for people with non it background this paper presents the feedrank system for the extraction aggregation semantic management and querying of web feeds the proposed system overcomes many of the limitations of conventional and passive web feed readers such as providing only simple presentations of what is received poor integration of correlated data from different sources and overwhelming the user with large traffic of feeds that are of no or low interest to them
in search engines ranking algorithms measure the importance and relevance of documents mainly based on the contents and relationships between documents user attributes are usually not considered in ranking this user neutral approach however may not meet the diverse interests of users who may demand different documents even with the same queries to satisfy this need for more personalized ranking we propose ranking framework social network document rank sndocrank that considers both document contents and the relationship between searched and document owners in social network this method combined the traditional tf idf ranking for document contents with out multi level actor similarity mas algorithm to measure to what extent document owners and the searcher are structurally similar in social network we implemented our ranking method in simulated video social network based on data extracted from youtube and tested its effectiveness on video search the results show that compared with the traditional ranking method like tf idfs the sndocrank algorithm returns more relevant documents more specifically searcher can get significantly better results be being in larger social network having more friends and being associated with larger local communities in social network
set sharing is an abstract domain in which each concrete object is represented by the set of local variables from which it might be reachable it is useful abstraction to detect parallelism opportunities since it contains definite information about which variables do not share in memory ie about when the memory regions reachable from those variables are disjoint set sharing is more precise alternative to pair sharing in which each domain element is set of all pairs of local variables from which common object may be reachable however the exponential complexity of some set sharing operations has limited its wider application this work introduces an efficient implementation of the set sharing domain using zero supressed binary decision diagrams zbdds because zbdds were designed to represent sets of combinations ie sets of sets they naturally represent elements of the set sharing domain we show how to synthesize the operations needed in the set sharing transfer functions from basic zbdd operations for some of the operations we devise custom zbdd algorithms that perform better in practice we also compare our implementation of the abstract domain with an efficient compact bitset based alternative and show that the zbdd version scales better in terms of both memory usage and running time
tiling is well known loop transformation to improve temporal locality of nested loops current compiler algorithms for tiling are limited to loops which are perfectly nested or can be transformed in trivial ways into perfect nest this paper presents number of program transformations to enable tiling for class of nontrivial imperfectly nested loops such that cache locality is improved we define program model for such loops and develop compiler algorithms for their tiling we propose to adopt odd even variable duplication to break anti and output dependences without unduly increasing the working set size and to adopt speculative execution to enable tiling of loops which may terminate prematurely due to eg convergence tests in iterative algorithms we have implemented these techniques in research compiler panorama initial experiments with several benchmark programs are performed on sgi workstations based on mips rk and rk processors overall the transformed programs run faster by to
recently progressive retrieval has been advocated as an alternate solution to multidimensional indexes or approximate techniques in order to accelerate similarity search of points in multidimensional spaces the principle of progressive search is to offer first subset of the answers to the user during retrieval if this subset satisfies the user's needs retrieval stops otherwise search resumes and after number of steps the exact answer set is returned to the user such process is justified by the fact that in large number of applications it is more interesting to rapidly bring first approximate answer sets rather than waiting for long time the exact answer set the contribution of this paper is first typology of existing techniques for progressive retrieval we survey variety of methods designed for image retrieval although some of them apply to general database browsing context which goes beyond cbir we also include techniques not designed for but that can easily be adapted to progressive retrieval
in large data warehousing environments it is often advantageous to provide fast approximate answers to complex aggregate queries based on statistical summaries of the full data in this paper we demonstrate the difficulty of providing good approximate answers for join queries using only statistics in particular samples from the base relations we propose join synopses as an effective solution for this problem and show how precomputing just one join synopsis for each relation suffices to significantly improve the quality of approximate answers for arbitrary queries with foreign key joins we present optimal strategies for allocating the available space among the various join synopses when the query work load is known and identify heuristics for the common case when the work load is not known we also present efficient algorithms for incrementally maintaining join synopses in the presence of updates to the base relations our extensive set of experiments on the tpc benchmark database show the effectiveness of join synopses and various other techniques proposed in this paper
software or hardware data cache prefetching is an efficient way to hide cache miss latency however effectiveness of the issued prefetches have to be monitored in order to maximize their positive impact while minimizing their negative impact on performance in previous proposed dynamic frameworks the monitoring scheme is either achieved using processor performance counters or using specific hardware in this work we propose prefetching strategy which does not use any specific hardware component or processor performance counter our dynamic framework wants to be portable on any modern processor architecture providing at least prefetch instruction opportunity and effectiveness of prefetching loads is simply guided by the time spent to effectively obtain the data every load of program is monitored periodically and can be either associated to dynamically inserted prefetch instruction or not it can be associated to prefetch instruction at some disjoint periods of the whole program run as soon as it is efficient our framework has been implemented for itanium machines it involves several dynamic instrumentations of the binary code whose overhead is limited to only on average on large set of benchmarks our system is able to speed up some programs by

despite the success of instruction level parallelism ilp optimizations in increasing the performance of microprocessors certain codes remain elusive in particular codes containing recursive data structure rds traversal loops have been largely immune to ilp optimizations due to the fundamental serialization and variable latency of the loop carried dependence through pointer chasing load to address these and other situations we introduce decoupled software pipelining dswp technique that statically splits single threaded sequential loop into multiple non speculative threads each of which performs useful computation essential for overall program correctness the resulting threads execute on thread parallel architectures such as simultaneous multithreaded smt cores or chip multiprocessors cmp expose additional instruction level parallelism and tolerate latency better than the original single threaded rds loop to reduce overhead these threads communicate using synchronization array dedicated hardware structure for pipelined inter thread communication dswp used in conjunction with the synchronization array achieves an to speedup in the optimized functions on both statically and dynamically scheduled processors

we address the problem of energy efficient reliable wireless communication in the presence of unreliable or lossy wireless link layers in multi hop wireless networks prior work has provided an optimal energy efficient solution to this problem for the case where link layers implement perfect reliability however more common scenario link layer that is not perfectly reliable was left as an open problem in this paper we first present two centralized algorithms bamer and gamer that optimally solve the minimum energy reliable communication problem in presence of unreliable links subsequently we present distributed algorithm damer that approximates the performance of the centralized algorithm and leads to significant performance improvement over existing single path or multi path based techniques
shared variable is an abstraction of persistent interprocess communication processors execute operations often concurrently on shared variables to exchange information among themselves the behavior of operation executions is required to be ldquo consistent rdquo for effective interprocess communication consequently consistency specification of shared variable describes some guarantees on the behavior of the operation executions read write shared variable has two operations write stores specified value in the variable and read returns value from the variable for read write variables consistency specification describes what values reads may return using an intuitive notion of illegality of reads we propose framework that facilitates specifying large variety of read write variables
recently an elegant routing protocol the zone routing protocol zrp was proposed to provide hybrid routing framework that is locally proactive and globally reactive with the goal of minimizing the sum of the proactive and reactive control overhead the key idea of zrp is that each node proactively advertises its link state over fixed number of hops called the zone radius these local advertisements provide each node with an updated view of its routing zone the collection of all nodes and links that are reachable within the zone radius the nodes on the boundary of the routing zone are called peripheral nodes and play an important role in the reactive zone based route discovery the main contribution of this work is to propose novel hybrid routing protocol the two zone routing protocol tzrp as nontrivial extension of zrp in contrast with the original zrp where single zone serves dual purpose tzrp aims to decouple the protocol's ability to adapt to traffic characteristics from its ability to adapt to mobility in support of this goal in tzrp each node maintains two zones crisp zone and fuzzy zone by adjusting the sizes of these two zones independently lower total routing control overhead can be achieved extensive simulation results show that tzrp is general manet routing framework that can balance the trade offs between various routing control overheads more effectively than zrp in wide range of network conditions

in this paper an improved differential cryptanalysis framework for finding collisions in hash functions is provided its principle is based on linearization of compression functions in order to find low weight differential characteristics as initiated by chabaud and joux this is formalized and refined however in several ways for the problem of finding conforming message pair whose differential trail follows linear trail condition function is introduced so that finding collision is equivalent to finding preimage of the zero vector under the condition function then the dependency table concept shows how much influence every input bit of the condition function has on each output bit careful analysis of the dependency table reveals degrees of freedom that can be exploited in accelerated preimage reconstruction under the condition function these concepts are applied to an in depth collision analysis of reduced round versions of the two sha candidates cubehash and md and are demonstrated to give by far the best currently known collision attacks on these sha candidates

the content user gap is the difference between the limited range of content relevant preferences that may be expressed using the mpeg user interaction tools and the much wider range of metadata that may be represented using the mpeg content tools one approach for closing this gap is to make the user and content metadata isomorphic by using the existing mpeg content tools to represent user as well as content metadata agius and angelides subsequently user preferences may be specified for all content without omission since there is wealth of user preference and history metadata within the mpeg user interaction tools that can usefully complement these specific content preferences in this paper we develop method by which all user and content metadata may be bridged

cooperation among computational nodes to solve common parallel application is one of the most outstanding features of grid environments however from the performance point of view it is very important that this cooperation will be made in an equilibrated way because otherwise some nodes can be overloaded whereas other nodes can be underused this paper presents camble cooperative awareness model for balancing the load in grid environments which applies some theoretical principles of awareness models to promote an efficient autonomous equilibrate and cooperative task delivery in grid environments this cooperative task management has been implemented and tested in real and heterogeneous grid infrastructure composed of several vo with very successful results this paper presents some of these outcomes while emphasizes on the overhead and efficacy of the system using this model
in this paper several enhanced sufficient conditions are given for minimal routing in dimensional meshes with faulty nodes contained in set of disjoint faulty blocks it is based on an early work of wu's minimal routing in meshes with faulty blocks unlike many traditional models that assume all the nodes know global fault distribution our approach is based on the notion of limited global fault information first fault model called faulty block is reviewed in which all faulty nodes in the system are contained in set of disjoint faulty blocks fault information is coded in tuple called extended safety level associated with each node of mesh to determine the feasibility of minimal routing specifically we study the existence of minimal route at given source node based on the associated extended safety level limited distribution of faulty block information and minimal routing an analytical model for the number of rows and columns that receive faulty block information is also given extensions to wang's minimal connected components mccs are also considered mccs are rectilinear monotone polygonal shaped fault blocks and are refinement of faulty blocks our simulation results show substantial improvement in terms of higher percentage of minimal routing in meshes under both fault models
this paper proposes and evaluates new mechanism rate windows for and network rate policing the goal of the proposed system is to provide simple yet effective way to enforce resource limits on target classes of jobs in system this work was motivated by our linger longer infrastructure which harvests idle cycles in networks of workstations network and throttling is crucial because linger longer can leave guest jobs on non idle nodes and machine owners should not be adversely affected our approach is quite simple we use sliding window of recent events to compute the average rate for target resource the assigned limit is enforced by the simple expedient of putting application processes to sleep when they issue requests that would bring their resource utilization out of the allowable profile our system call intercept model makes the rate windows mechanism light weight and highly portable our experimental results show that we are able to limit resource usage to within few percent of target usages
two oft cited file systems the fast file system ffs and the log structured file system lfs adopt two sharply different update strategies update in place and update out of place this paper introduces the design and implementation of hybrid file system called hfs which combines the strengths of ffs and lfs while avoiding their weaknesses this is accomplished by distributing file system data into two partitions based on their size and type in hfs data blocks of large regular files are stored in data partition arranged in ffs like fashion while metadata and small files are stored in separate log partition organized in the spirit of lfs but without incurring any cleaning overhead this segregation makes it possible to use more appropriate layouts for different data than would otherwise be possible in particular hfs has the ability to perform clustered on all kinds of data including small files metadata and large files we have implemented prototype of hfs on freebsd and have compared its performance against three file systems including ffs with soft updates port of netbsd's lfs and our lightweight journaling file system called yfs results on number of benchmarks show that hfs has excellent small file and metadata performance for example hfs beats ffs with soft updates in the range from to in the postmark benchmark
key scalability challenge for interprocedural dataflow analysis comes from large libraries our work addresses this challenge for the general category of interprocedural distributive environment ide dataflow problems using pre computed library summary information the proposed approach reduces significantly the cost of whole program ide analyses without any loss of precision we define an approach for library summary generation by using graph representation of dataflow summary functions and by abstracting away redundant dataflow facts that are internal to the library our approach also handles object oriented features by employing an ide type analysis as well as special handling of polymorphic library call sites whose target methods depend on the future unknown client code experimental results show that dramatic cost savings can be achieved with the help of these techniques
person name queries often bring up web pages that correspond to individuals sharing the same name the web people search weps task consists of organizing search results for ambiguous person name queries into meaningful clusters with each cluster referring to one individual this paper presents fuzzy ant based clustering approach for this multi document person name disambiguation problem the main advantage of fuzzy ant based clustering technique inspired by the behavior of ants clustering dead nestmates into piles is that no specification of the number of output clusters is required this makes the algorithm very well suited for the web person disambiguation task where we do not know in advance how many individuals each person name refers to we compare our results with state of the art partitional and hierarchical clustering approaches means and agnes and demonstrate favorable results this is particularly interesting as the latter involve manual setting of similarity threshold or estimating the number of clusters in advance while the fuzzy ant based clustering algorithm does not
in data stream applications data arrive continuously and can only be scanned once as the query processor has very limited memory relative to the size of the stream to work with hence queries on data streams do not have access to the entire data set and query answers are typically approximate while there have been many studies on the nearest neighbors knn problem in conventional multi dimensional databases the solutions cannot be directly applied to data streams for the above reasons in this paper we investigate the knn problem over data streams we first introduce the approximate knn eknn problem that finds the approximate knn answers of query point such that the absolute error of the th nearest neighbor distance is bounded by to support eknn queries over streams we propose technique called disc adaptive indexing on streams by space filling curves disc can adapt to different data distributions to either optimize memory utilization to answer eknn queries under certain accuracy requirements or achieve the best accuracy under given memory constraint at the same time disc provide efficient updates and query processing which are important requirements in data stream applications extensive experiments were conducted using both synthetic and real data sets and the results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of disc
the main drawbacks of handheld devices small storage space small size of the display screen discontinuance of the connection to the wlan etc are often incompatible with the need of querying and browsing information extracted from enormous amounts of data which are accessible through the network in this application scenario data compression and summarization have leading role data in lossy compressed format can be transmitted more efficiently than the original ones and can be effectively stored in handheld devices setting the compression ratio accordingly in this paper we introduce very effective compression technique for multidimensional data cubes and the system hand olap which exploits this technique to allow handheld devices to extract and browse compressed two dimensional olap views coming from multidimensional data cubes stored on remote olap server localized on the wired network hand olap effectively and efficiently enables olap in mobile environments and also enlarges the potentialities of decision support systems by taking advantage from the naturally decentralized nature of such environments the idea which the system is based on is rather than querying the original multidimensional data cubes it may be more convenient to generate compressed olap view of them store such view into the handheld device and query it locally off line thus obtaining approximate answers that are suitable for olap applications

interacting with mobile applications and services remains difficult for users because of the impact of mobility on both device capabilities and the cognitive resources of users in this paper we explore the idea that interaction with mobile services can be made faster and more convenient if users are allowed to speculatively prepare in advance the services they wish to use and the data they will need essentially we propose to enable users to offset difficult interactions while mobile with larger number of interactions conducted in the desktop environment to illustrate the concept of offsetting we have developed prototype we call the context clipboard early feedback suggests that majority of the participants are in favour of the concept and that they may be prepared to use explicit preparation behaviour to simplify future interactions we close with our reflections on key implications for systems design and challenges for taking this work forward
this paper presents novel approach to automatic image annotation which combines global regional and contextual features by an extended cross media relevance model unlike typical image annotation methods which use either global or regional features exclusively as well as neglect the textual context information among the annotated words the proposed approach incorporates the three kinds of information which are helpful to describe image semantics to annotate images by estimating their joint probability specifically we describe the global features as distribution vector of visual topics and model the textual context as multinomial distribution the global features provide the global distribution of visual topics over an image while the textual context relaxes the assumption of mutual independence among annotated words which is commonly adopted in most existing methods both the global features and textual context are learned by probability latent semantic analysis approach from the training data the experiments over corel images have shown that combining these three kinds of information is beneficial in image annotation
in diverse applications ranging from stock trading to traffic monitoring popular data streams are typically monitored by multiple analysts for patterns of interest these analysts may submit similar pattern mining requests such as cluster detection queries yet customized with different parameter settings in this work we present an efficient shared execution strategy for processing large number of density based cluster detection queries with arbitrary parameter settings given the high algorithmic complexity of the clustering process and the real time responsiveness required by streaming applications serving multiple such queries in single system is extremely resource intensive the naive method of detecting and maintaining clusters for different queries independently is often in feasible in practice as its demands on system resources increase dramatically with the cardinality of the query workload to overcome this we analyze the interrelations between the cluster sets identified by queries with different parameters settings including both pattern specific and window specific parameters we introduce the notion of the growth property among the cluster sets identified by different queries and characterize the conditions under which it holds by exploiting this growth property we propose uniform solution called chandi which represents identified cluster sets as one single compact structure and performs integrated maintenance on them resulting in significant sharing of computational and memory resources our comprehensive experimental study using real data streams from domains of stock trades and moving object monitoring demonstrates that chandi is on average four times faster than the best alternative methods while using less memory space in our test cases it also shows that chandi scales in handling large numbers of queries on the order of hundreds or even thousands under high input data rates
when building enterprise applications that need to be accessed through variety of client devices developers usually strive to implement most of the business logic device independently while using web browser to display the user interface however when those web based front ends shall be rendered on different devices their differing capabilities may require device specific interaction patterns that still need to be specified and implemented efficiently we present an approach for specifying the dialog flows in multi channel web interfaces with very low redundancy and introduce framework that controls web interfaces device specific dialog flows according to those specifications while keeping the enterprise application logic completely device independent
besides the steady growing of size complexity and distribution of present day information systems business volatility with rapid changes in users wishes and technological upgrading are stressing an overwhelmingly need for more advanced conceptual modeling approaches such advanced conceptual models should coherently and soundly reflect these three crucial dimensions namely the size space and evolution over time dimensions in contribution towards such advanced conceptual approaches we presented in data know eng new form of integration of object orientation with emphasize on componentization into variety of algebraic petri nets we referred to as co netsthe purpose of the present paper is to soundly extend this proposal for coping with dynamic changing of structural and behavioral aspects of co nets components to this aim we are proposing an adequate petri net based meta level that may be sketched as follows first we construct two meta nets for each component one concerns the modification of behavioral aspects and the other is for dealing with structural aspects while the meta net for behavioral dynamic enables the dynamic of any transition in given component to be modified at runtime the meta net for structural aspects completes and enhances these capabilities by allowing involved messages and object signatures ie structure to be dynamically manipulated in addition of rigorous description of this meta level and its illustration using medium complexity banking system example we also discuss how this level brings satisfactory solution to the well known inheritance anomaly problem
aspect oriented programming aop is attracting attention from both research and industry as illustrated by the ever growing popularity of aspectj the de facto standard aop extension of java from compiler construction perspective aspectj is interesting as it is typical example of compositional language ie language composed of number of separate languages with different syntactical styles in addition to plain java aspectj includes language for defining pointcuts and one for defining advices language composition represents non trivial challenge for conventional parsing techniques first combining several languages with different lexical syntax leads to considerable complexity in the lexical states to processed second as new language features for aop are being explored many research proposals are concerned with further extending the aspectj language resulting in need for an extensible syntax definitionthis paper shows how scannerless parsing elegantly addresses the issues encountered by conventional techniques when parsing aspectj we present the design of modular extensible and formal definition of the lexical and context free aspects of the aspectj syntax in the syntax definition formalism sdf which is implemented by scannerless generalized lr parser sglr we introduce grammar mixins as novel application of sdf's modularity features which allows the declarative definition of different keyword policies and combination of extensions we illustrate the modular extensibility of our definition with syntax extensions taken from current research on aspect languages finally benchmarks show the reasonable performance of scannerless generalized lr parsing for this grammar
most contemporary database systems perform cost based join enumeration using some variant of system r's bottom up dynamic programming method the notable exceptions are systems based on the top down transformational search of volcano cascades as recent work has demonstrated bottom up dynamic programming can attain optimality with respect to the shape of the join graph no comparable results have been published for transformational search however transformational systems leverage benefits of top down search not available to bottom up methods in this paper we describe top down join enumeration algorithm that is optimal with respect to the join graph we present performance results demonstrating that combination of optimal enumeration with search strategies such as branch and bound yields an algorithm significantly faster than those previously described in the literature although our algorithm enumerates the search space top down it does not rely on transformations and thus retains much of the architecture of traditional dynamic programming as such this work provides migration path for existing bottom up optimizers to exploit top down search without drastically changing to the transformational paradigm

xml has become widely accepted standard for modelling storing and exchanging structured documents taking advantage of the document structure can result in improving the retrieval performance of xml documents notably growing number of these documents are stored in peer to peer networks which are promising self organizing infrastructures documents are distributed over the peer to peer network by either being stored locally on individual peers or by being assigned to collections such as digital libraries current search methods for xml documents in peer to peer networks lack the use of information retrieval techniques for vague queries and relevance detection our work aims for the development of search engine for xml documents where information retrieval methods are enhanced by using structural information documents and global index are distributed over peer to peer network building virtually unlimited storage space in this paper conceptual architecture for xml information retrieval in peer to peer networks is proposed based on this general architecture component structured architecture for concrete search engine is presented which uses an extension of the vector space model to compute relevance for dynamic xml documents
in this paper we propose new framework to perform motion compression for time dependent geometric data temporal coherence in dynamic geometric models can be used to achieve significant compression thereby leading to efficient storage and transmission of large volumes of data the displacement of the vertices in the geometric models is computed using the iterative closest point icp algorithm this forms the core of our motion prediction technique and is used to estimate the transformation between two successive data sets the motion between frames is coded in terms of few affine parameters with some added residues our motion segmentation approach separates the vertices into two groups within the first group motion can be encoded with few affine parameters without the need of residues in the second group the vertices need further encoding of residual errors also in this group for those vertices associated with large residual errors under affine mapping we encode their motion effectively using newtonian motion estimates this automatic segmentation enables our algorithm to he very effective in compressing time dependent geometric data dynamic range data captured from the real world as well as complex animations created using commercial tools can be compressed efficiently using this scheme
general technique combining model checking and abstraction is presented that allows property based analysis of systems consisting of an arbitrary number of featured components we show how parameterised systems can be specified in guarded command form with constraints placed on variables which occur in guards we prove that results that hold for small number of components can be shown to scale up we then show how featured systems can be specified in similar way by relaxing constraints on guards the main result is generalisation theorem for featured systems which we apply to two well known examples
sensor networks have been widely used to collect data about the environment when analyzing data from these systems people tend to ask exploratory questions they want to find subsets of data namely signal reflecting some characteristics of the environment in this paper we study the problem of searching for drops in sensor data specifically the search is to find periods in history when certain amount of drop over threshold occurs in data within time span we propose framework segdiff for extracting features compressing them and transforming the search into standard database queries approximate results are returned from the framework with the guarantee that no true events are missed and false positives are within user specified tolerance the framework efficiently utilizes space and provides fast response to users search experimental results with real world data demonstrate the efficiency of our framework with respect to feature size and search time

type checking and type inference are fundamentally similar problems however the algorithms for performing the two operations on the same type system often differ significantly the type checker is typically straightforward encoding of the original type rules for many systems type inference is performed using two phase constraint based algorithmwe present an approach that given the original type rules written as clauses in logic programming language automatically generates an efficient two phase constraint based type inference algorithm our approach works by partially evaluating the type checking rules with respect to the target program to yield set of constraints suitable for input to an external constraint solver this approach avoids the need to manually develop and verify separate type inference algorithm and is ideal for experimentation with and rapid prototyping of novel type systems

novel approach to real time string filtering of large databases is presented the proposed approach is based on combination of artificial neural networks and operates in two stages the first stage employs self organizing map for performing approximate string matching and retrieving those strings of the database which are similar to ie assigned to the same som node as the query string the second stage employs harmony theory network for comparing the previously retrieved strings in parallel with the query string and determining whether an exact match exists the experimental results demonstrate accurate fast and database size independent string filtering which is robust to database modifications the proposed approach is put forward for general purpose directory catalogue and glossary search and internet mail blocking intrusion detection systems url and username classification applications
many problems in distributed computing are impossible when no information about process failures is available it is common to ask what information about failures is necessary and sufficient to circumvent some specific impossibility eg consensus atomic commit mutual exclusion etc this paper asks what information about failures is needed to circumvent any impossibility and sufficient to circumvent some impossibility in other words what is the minimal yet non trivial failure informatio we present an abstraction denoted that provides very little failure information in every run of the distributed system eventually informs the processes that some set of processes in the system cannot be the set of correct processes in that run although seemingly weak for it might provide random information for an arbitrarily long period of time and it only excludes one possibility of correct set among many still captures non trivial failure information we show that is sufficient to circumvent the fundamental wait free set agreement impossibility while doing so we disprove previous conjectures about the weakest failure detector to solve set agreement and we prove that solving set agreement with registers is strictly weaker than solving process consensus using process consensus we prove that is in precise sense minimal to circumvent any wait free impossibility roughly we show that is the weakest eventually stable failure detect or to circumvent any wait free impossibility our results are generalized through an abstraction υf that we introduce and prove necessary to solve any problem that cannot be solved in an resilient manner and yet sufficient to solve resilient set agreement
data preparation is an important and critical step in neural network modeling for complex data analysis and it has huge impact on the success of wide variety of complex data analysis tasks such as data mining and knowledge discovery although data preparation in neural network data analysis is important some existing literature about the neural network data preparation are scattered and there is no systematic study about data preparation for neural network data analysis in this study we first propose an integrated data preparation scheme as systematic study for neural network data analysis in the integrated scheme survey of data preparation focusing on problems with the data and corresponding processing techniques is then provided meantime some intelligent data preparation solution to some important issues and dilemmas with the integrated scheme are discussed in detail subsequently cost benefit analysis framework for this integrated scheme is presented to analyze the effect of data preparation on complex data analysis finally typical example of complex data analysis from the financial domain is provided in order to show the application of data preparation techniques and to demonstrate the impact of data preparation on complex data analysis
the key to increasing performance without commensurate increase in power consumption in modern processors lies in increasing both parallelism and core specialization core specialization has been employed in the embedded space and is likely to play an important role in future heterogeneous multi core architectures as well in this paper the face recognition application domain is employed as case study to showcase an architectural design methodology which generates specialized core with high performance and very low powercharacteristics specifically we create asic like execution flows to sustain the high memory parallelism generated within the core the price of this benefit is significant increase in compilation complexity the crux of the problem is the need to co schedule the often conflicting constraints of data access data movement and computation modular compiler approach that employs integer linear programming ilp based interconnect aware instruction and data scheduling techniques to solve this problem is then described the resulting core running the compiled code delivers throughput improvement over high performance processor pentium while simultaneously achieving an energy delay improvement over an energy efficient processor xscale and performs real time face recognition at embedded power budgets
in the ubiquitous computing environment people will interact with everyday objects or computers embedded in them in ways different from the usual and familiar desktop user interface one such typical situation is interacting with applications through large displays such as televisions mirror displays and public kiosks with these applications the use of the usual keyboard and mouse input is not usually viable for practical reasons in this setting the mobile phone has emerged as an excellent device for novel interaction this article introduces user interaction techniques using camera equipped hand held device such as mobile phone or pda for large shared displays in particular we consider two specific but typical situations sharing the display from distance and interacting with touch screen display at close distance using two basic computer vision techniques motion flow and marker recognition we show how camera equipped hand held device can effectively be used to replace mouse and share select and manipulate and objects and navigate within the environment presented through the large display
similarity search has been proved suitable for searching in large collections of unstructured data objects number of practical index data structures for this purpose have been proposed all of them have been devised to process single queries sequentially however in large scale systems such as web search engines indexing multi media content it is critical to deal efficiently with streams of queries rather than with single queries in this paper we show how to achieve efficient and scalable performance in this context to this end we transform sequential index based on clustering into distributed one and devise algorithms and optimizations specially tailored to support high performance parallel query processing
data integration systems provide access to set of heterogeneous autonomous data sources through so called global schema there are basically two approaches for designing data integration system in the global as view approach one defines the elements of the global schema as views over the sources whereas in the local as view approach one characterizes the sources as views over the global schema it is well known that processing queries in the latter approach is similar to query answering with incomplete information and therefore is complex task on the other hand it is common opinion that query processing is much easier in the former approach in this paper we show the surprising result that when the global schema is expressed in the relational model with integrity constraints even of simple types the problem of incomplete information implicitly arises making query processing difficult in the global as view approach as well we then focus on global schemas with key and foreign key constraints which represents situation which is very common in practice and we illustrate techniques for effectively answering queries posed to the data integration system in this case
we consider the view selection problem for xml content based routing given network in which stream of xml documents is routed and the routing decisions are taken based on results of evaluating xpath predicates on these documents select set of views that maximize the throughput of the network while in view selection for relational queries the speedup comes from eliminating joins here the speedup is obtained from gaining direct access to data values in an xml packet without parsing that packet the views in our context can be seen as binary representation of the xml document tailored for the network's workloadin this paper we define formally the view selection problem in the context of xml content based routing and provide practical solution for it first we formalize the problem while the exact formulation is too complex to admit practical solutions we show that it can be simplified to manageable optimization problem without loss in precision second we show that the simplified problem can be reduced to the integer cover problem the integer cover problem is known to be np hard and to admit log greedy approximation algorithm third we show that the same greedy approximation algorithm performs much better on class of work loads called hierarchical workloads which are typical in xml stream processing namely it returns an optimal solution for hierarchical workloads and degrades gracefully to the log general bound as the workload becomes less hierarchical

security typed languages such as jif require the programmer to label variables with information flow security policies as part of application development the compiler then flags errors wherever information leaks may occur resolving these information leaks is critical task in security typed language application development unfortunately because information flows can be quite subtle simple error messages tend to be insufficient for finding and resolving the source of information leaks more sophisticated development tools are needed for this task to this end we provide set of principles to guide the development of such tools furthermore we implement subset of these principles in an integrated development environment ide for jif called jifclipse which is built on the eclipse extensible development platform our plug in provides jif programmer with additional tools to view hidden information generated by jif compilation to suggest fixes for errors and to get more specific information behind an error message better development tools are essential for making security typed application development practical jifclipse is first step in this process
requests for communication via mobile devices can be disruptive to the current task or social situation to reduce the frequency of disruptive requests one promising approach is to provide callers with cues of receiver's context through an awareness display allowing informed decisions of when to call existing displays typically provide cues based on what can be readily sensed which may not match what is needed during the call decision process in this paper we report results of four week diary study of mobile phone usage where users recorded what context information they considered when making call and what information they wished others had considered when receiving call our results were distilled into lessons that can be used to improve the design of awareness displays for mobile devices eg show frequency of receiver's recent communication and distance from receiver to her phone we discuss technologies that can enable cues indicated in these lessons to be realized within awareness displays as well as discuss limitations of such displays and issues of privacy

we show that large class of data flow analyses for imperative languages are describable as type systems in the following technical sense possible results of an analysis can be described in language of types so that program checks with type if and only if this type is supertype of the result of applying the analysis type checking is easy with the help of certificate that records the eureka bits of typing derivation certificate assisted type checking amounts to form of lightweight analysis la rose for secure information flow we obtain type system that is considerably more precise than that of volpano et al but not more sophisticated importantly our type systems are compositional
there has been much work in recent years on extending ml with recursive modules one of the most difficult problems in the development of such an extension is the double vision problem which concerns the interaction of recursion and data abstraction in previous work defined type system called rtg which solves the double vision problem at the level of system style core calculus in this paper scale the ideas and techniques of rtg to the level of recursive ml style module calculus called rmc thus establishing that no tradeoff between data abstraction and recursive modules is necessary first describe rmc's typing rules for recursive modules informally and discuss some of the design questions that arose in developing them then present the formal semantics of rmc which is interesting in its own right the formalization synthesizes aspects of both the definition and the harper stone interpretation of standard ml and includes novel two pass algorithm for recursive module typechecking in which the coherence of the two passes is emphasized by their representation in terms of the same set of inference rules

we study oblivious routing in fat tree based system area networks with deterministic routing under the assumption that the traffic demand is uncertain the performance of routing algorithm under uncertain traffic demands is characterized by the oblivious performance ratio that bounds the relative performance of the routing algorithm with respect to the optimal algorithm for any given traffic demand we consider both single path routing where only one path is used to carry the traffic between each source destination pair and multipath routing where multiple paths are allowed for single path routing we derive lower bounds of the oblivious performance ratio for different fat trees and develop routing schemes that achieve the optimal oblivious performance ratios for commonly used topologies our evaluation results indicate that the proposed oblivious routing schemes not only provide the optimal worst case performance guarantees but also outperform existing schemes in average cases for multipath routing we show that it is possible to obtain an optimal scheme for all traffic demands an oblivious performance ratio of these results quantitatively demonstrate the performance difference between single path routing and multipath routing in fat trees
programming paradigms are designed to express algorithms elegantly and efficiently there are many parallel programming paradigms each suited to certain class of problems selecting the best parallel programming paradigm for problem minimizes programming effort and maximizes performance given the increasing complexity of parallel applications no one paradigm may be suitable for all components of an application today most parallel scientific applications are programmed with single paradigm and the challenge of multi paradigm parallel programming remains unmet in the broader communitywe believe that each component of parallel program should be programmed using the most suitable paradigm furthermore it is not sufficient to simply bolt modules together programmers should be able to switch between paradigms easily and resource management across paradigms should be automatic we present pre existing adaptive runtime system arts and show how it can be used to meet these challenges by allowing the simultaneous use of multiple parallel programming paradigms and supporting resource management across all of them we discuss the implementation of some common paradigms within the arts and demonstrate the use of multiple paradigms within our featurerich unstructured mesh framework we show how this approach boosts performance and productivity for an application developed using this framework

xml has become the lingua franca for data exchange and integration across administrative and enterprise boundaries nearly all data providers are adding xml import or export capabilities and standard xml schemas and dtds are being promoted for all types of data sharing the ubiquity of xml has removed one of the major obstacles to integrating data from widely disparate sources namely the heterogeneity of data formats however general purpose integration of data across the wide are also requires query processor that can query data sources on demand receive streamed xml data from them and combine and restructure the data into new xml output while providing good performance for both batch oriented and ad hoc interactive queries this is the goal of the tukwila data integration system the first system that focuses on network bound dynamic xml data sources in contrast to previous approaches which must read parse and often store entire xml objects before querying them tukwila can return query results even as the data is streaming into the system tukwila is built with new system architecture that extends adaptive query processing and relational engine techniques into the xml realm as facilitated by pair of operators that incrementally evaluate query's input path expressions as data is read in this paper we describe the tukwila architecture and its novel aspects and we experimentally demonstrate that tukwila provides better overall query performance and faster initial answers than existing systems and has excellent scalability

during the last two decades wide variety of advanced methods for the visual exploration of large data sets have been proposed for most of these techniques user interaction has become crucial element since there are many situations in which users or analysts have to select the right parameter settings from among many in order to construct insightful visualizations the right choice of input parameters is essential since suboptimal parameter settings or the investigation of irrelevant data dimensions make the exploration process more time consuming and may result in wrong conclusions but finding the right parameters is often tedious process and it becomes almost impossible for an analyst to find an optimal parameter setting manually because of the volume and complexity of today's data sets therefore we propose novel approach for automatically determining meaningful parameter and attribute settings based on the combined analysis of the data space and the resulting visualizations with respect to given task our technique automatically analyzes pixel images resulting from visualizations created from diverse parameter mappings and ranks them according to the potential value for the user this allows more effective and more efficient visual data analysis process since the attribute parameter space is reduced to meaningful selections and thus the analyst obtains faster insight into the data real world applications are provided to show the benefit of the proposed approach
procrastination scheduling has gained importance for energy efficiency due to the rapid increase in the leakage power consumption under procrastination scheduling task executions are delayed to extend processor shutdown intervals thereby reducing the idle energy consumption we propose algorithms to compute the maximum procrastination intervals for tasks scheduled by either the fixed priority or the dual priority scheduling policy we show that dual priority scheduling always guarantees longer shutdown intervals than fixed priority scheduling we further combine procrastination scheduling with dynamic voltage scaling to minimize the total static and dynamic energy consumption of the system our simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithms can extend the sleep intervals up to times while meeting the timing requirements the results show up to energy gains over dynamic voltage scaling

data cube has been playing an essential role in fast olap online analytical processing in many multi dimensional data warehouses however there exist data sets in applications like bioinformatics statistics and text processing that are characterized by high dimensionality eg over dimensions and moderate size eg around tuples no feasible data cube can be constructed with such data sets in this paper we will address the problem of developing an efficient algorithm to perform olap on such data sets experience tells us that although data analysis tasks may involve high dimensional space most olap operations are performed only on small number of dimensions at time based on this observation we propose novel method that computes thin layer of the data cube together with associated value list indices this layer while being manageable in size will be capable of supporting flexible and fast olap operations in the original high dimensional space through experiments we will show that the method has costs that scale nicely with dimensionality furthermore the costs are comparable to that of accessing an existing data cube when full materialization is possible

the processing of xml queries can result in evaluation of various structural relationships efficient algorithms for evaluating ancestor descendant and parent child relationships have been proposed whereas the problems of evaluating preceding sibling following sibling and preceding following relationships are still open in this paper we studied the structural join and staircase join for sibling relationship first the idea of how to filter out and minimize unnecessary reads of elements using parent's structural information is introduced which can be used to accelerate structural joins of parent child and preceding sibling following sibling relationships second two efficient structural join algorithms of sibling relationship are proposed these algorithms lead to optimal join performance nodes that do not participate in the join can be judged beforehand and then skipped using tree index besides each element list joined is scanned sequentially once at most furthermore output of join results is sorted in document order we also discussed the staircase join algorithm for sibling axes studies show that staircase join for sibling axes is close to the structural join for sibling axes and shares the same characteristic of high efficiency our experimental results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimizing techniques for sibling axes but also validate the efficiency of our algorithms as far as we know this is the first work addressing this problem specially
computing clusters cc consisting of several connected machines could provide high performance multiuser time sharing environment for executing parallel and sequential jobs in order to achieve good performance in such an environment it is necessary to assign processes to machines in manner that ensures efficient allocation of resources among the jobs this paper presents opportunity cost algorithms for online assignment of jobs to machines in cc these algorithms are designed to improve the overall cpu utilization of the cluster and to reduces the and the interprocess communication ipc overhead our approach is based on known theoretical results on competitive algorithms the main contribution of the paper is how to adapt this theory into working algorithms that can assign jobs to machines in manner that guarantees near optimal utilization of the cpu resource for jobs that perform and ipc operations the developed algorithms are easy to implement we tested the algorithms by means of simulations and executions in real system and show that they outperform existing methods for process allocation that are based on ad hoc heuristics

we propose new instruction branch on random that is like standard conditional branch except rather than specifying the condition on which the branch should be taken it specifies frequency at which the branch should be taken we show that branch on random is useful for reducing the overhead of program instrumentation via sampling specifically branch on random provides an order of magnitude reduction in execution time overhead compared to previously proposed software only frameworks for instrumentation sampling furthermore we demonstrate that branch on random can be cleanly architected and implemented simply and efficiently for simple processors we estimate that branch on random can be implemented with bits of state and less than gates for aggressive superscalars this grows to less than bits of state and at most few hundred gates
sharir and welzl introduced an abstract framework for optimization problems called lp type problems or also generalized linear programming problems which proved useful in algorithm design we define new and as we believe simpler and more natural framework violator spaces which constitute proper generalization of lp type problems we show that clarkson's randomized algorithms for low dimensional linear programming work in the context of violator spaces for example in this way we obtain the fastest known algorithm for the matrix generalized linear complementarity problem with constant number of blocks we also give two new characterizations of lp type problems they are equivalent to acyclic violator spaces as well as to concrete lp type problems informally the constraints in concrete lp type problem are subsets of linearly ordered ground set and the value of set of constraints is the minimum of its intersection
sql extensions that allow queries to explicitly specify data quality requirements in terms of currency and consistency were proposed in an earlier paper this paper develops data quality aware finer grained cache model and studies cache design in terms of four fundamental properties presence consistency completeness and currency the model provides an abstract view of the cache to the query processing layer and opens the door for adaptive cache management we describe an implementation approach that builds on the mtcache framework for partially materialized views the optimizer checks most consistency constraints and generates dynamic plan that includes currency checks and inexpensive checks for dynamic consistency constraints that cannot be validated during optimization our solution not only supports transparent caching but also provides fine grained data currency and consistency guarantees

in this work we analyze the complexity of local broadcasting in the physical interference model we present two distributed randomized algorithms one that assumes that each node knows how many nodes there are in its geographical proximity and another which makes no assumptions about topology knowledge we show that if the transmission probability of each node meets certain characteristics the analysis can be decoupled from the global nature of the physical interference model and each node performs successful local broadcast in time proportional to the number of neighbors in its physical proximity we also provide worst case optimality guarantees for both algorithms and demonstrate their behavior in average scenarios through simulations
we consider the problem if given program satisfies specified safety property interesting programs have infinite state spaces with inputs ranging over infinite domains and for these programs the property checking problem is undecidable two broad approaches to property checking are testing and verification testing tries to find inputs and executions which demonstrate violations of the property verification tries to construct formal proof which shows that all executions of the program satisfy the property testing works best when errors are easy to find but it is often difficult to achieve sufficient coverage for correct programs on the other hand verification methods are most successful when proofs are easy to find but they are often inefficient at discovering errors we propose new algorithm synergy which combines testing and verification synergy unifies several ideas from the literature including counterexample guided model checking directed testing and partition refinementthis paper presents description of the synergy algorithm its theoretical properties comparison with related algorithms and prototype implementation called yogi
this paper presents our toolkit for developing java bytecode translator bytecode translation is getting important in various domains such as generative programming and aspect oriented programming to help the users easily develop translator the design of our toolkit is based on the reflective architecture however the previous implementations of this architecture involved serious runtime penalties to address this problem our toolkit uses custom compiler so that the runtime penalties are minimized since the previous version of our toolkit named javassist has been presented in another paper this paper focuses on this new compiler support for performance improvement this feature was not included in the previous version
click fraud is jeopardizing the industry of internet advertising internet advertising is crucial for the thriving of the entire internet since it allows producers to advertise their products and hence contributes to the well being of commerce moreover advertising supports the intellectual value of the internet by covering the running expenses of publishing content some content publishers are dishonest and use automation to generate traffic to defraud the advertisers similarly some advertisers automate clicks on the advertisements of their competitors to deplete their competitors advertising budgets this paper describes the advertising network model and focuses on the most sophisticated type of fraud which involves coalitions among fraudsters we build on several published theoretical results to devise the similarity seeker algorithm that discovers coalitions made by pairs of fraudsters we then generalize the solution to coalitions of arbitrary sizes before deploying our system on real network we conducted comprehensive experiments on data samples for proof of concept the results were very accurate we detected several coalitions formed using various techniques and spanning numerous sites this reveals the generality of our model and approach
regular path queries are the building blocks of almost any mechanism for querying semistructured data despite the fact that the main applications of such data are distributed there are only few works dealing with distributed evaluation of regular path queries in this paper we present message efficient and truly distributed algorithm for computing the answer to regular path queries in multi source semistructured database setting our algorithm is general as it works for the larger class of weighted regular path queries on weighted semistructured databases also we show how to make our algorithm fault tolerant to smoothly work in environments prone to process or machine failures this is very desirable in grid setting which is today's new paradigm of distributed computing and where one does not have full control over machines that can unexpectedly leave in the middle of computation
in this paper we address the problem of garbage collection in single failure fault tolerant home based lazy release consistency hlrc distributed shared memory dsm system based on independent checkpointing and logging our solution uses laziness in garbage collection and exploits consistency constraints of the hlrc memory model for low overhead and scalability we prove safe bounds on the state that must be retained in the system to guarantee correct recovery after failure we devise two algorithms for garbage collection of checkpoints and logs checkpoint garbage collection cgc and lazy log trimming llt the proposed approach targets large scale distributed shared memory computing on local area clusters of computers in such systems using global synchronization or extra communication for garbage collection is inefficient or simply impractical due to system scale and temporary disconnections in communication the challenge lies in controlling the size of the logs and the number of checkpoints without global synchronization while tolerating transient disruptions in communication our garbage collection scheme is completely distributed does not force processes to synchronize does not add extra messages to the base dsm protocol and uses only the available dsm protocol information evaluation results for real applications show that it effectively bounds the number of past checkpoints to be retained and the size of the logs in stable storage

gaifman shapiro style architecture of program modules is introduced in the case of normal logic programs under stable model semantics the composition of program modules is suitably limited by module conditions which ensure the compatibility of the module system with stable models the resulting module theorem properly strengthens lifschitz and turner's splitting set theorem for normal logic programs consequently the respective notion of equivalence between modules ie modular equivalence proves to be congruence relation moreover it is shown how our translation based verification method is accommodated to the case of modular equivalence and how the verification of weak visible equivalence can be optimized as sequence of module level tests

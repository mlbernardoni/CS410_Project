        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is true that the aging and disabled residents of apartments are left to die alone with little social contact in big cities like San Francisco (news article, June 25). The problems of aging often lead to the loss of contact with the outside world. Many of the elderly simply fade away suffering from loneliness and depression with virtually no attention from social services.</p>

        <p>It is true that the aging and disabled residents of apartments are left to die alone with little social contact in big cities like San Francisco (news article, June 25). The problems of aging often lead to the loss of contact with the outside world. Many of the elderly simply fade away suffering from loneliness and depression with virtually no attention from social services.</p>
        <p>It is unacceptable that frail elderly people face such a bleak end to their lives in the wealthiest nation in the world. Because of better social services and universal health care, the older people in Scandinavia and Western European countries are receiving much better care. Shouldn't we, as a nation with constant reports of budget surplus, be the best in providing high-quality care and prevent the elderly from dying destitute?</p>
